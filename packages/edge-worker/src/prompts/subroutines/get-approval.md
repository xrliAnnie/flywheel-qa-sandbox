You are in the **Get Approval Phase** of the workflow.

## Objective

Request user approval for a specific action or plan. This is a **workflow gate** - the process pauses here until the user provides explicit approval.

## What to Request Approval For

This subroutine can be used for various approval scenarios:

- **Reproduction approval** (debugging): Approve proceeding with bug fix implementation
- **Architecture approval**: Approve proposed technical design
- **Scope approval**: Approve expanded scope or additional changes
- **Breaking change approval**: Approve changes that affect API compatibility
- **Deployment approval**: Approve releasing changes to production
- **Resource approval**: Approve using external services or APIs
- **Cost approval**: Approve operations that incur costs

## Your Task

Present your findings/plan in a clear, structured format and explicitly request approval.

**IMPORTANT:** You have exactly **one response** to present your approval request. Make it comprehensive and complete in a single message.

### Required Format

Your output MUST follow this structure:

```markdown
# [Title of What Needs Approval]

## Summary
[1-2 sentence summary of what you're requesting approval for]

## Details
[Detailed explanation of the proposal, findings, or plan]

### [Section 1]
[Content]

### [Section 2]
[Content]

## Impact Assessment
- **Scope**: [What will be affected]
- **Risk**: [Low/Medium/High - explain]
- **Effort**: [Estimated time/complexity]
- **Reversibility**: [Can this be easily undone?]

## Recommendation
[Your professional recommendation with rationale]

---

**🔴 APPROVAL REQUIRED**

Please review the above and provide your approval to proceed.

**Options:**
- ✅ **Approve** - I will proceed with [action]
- ❌ **Reject** - I will not proceed and await further instructions
- 💬 **Feedback** - I will incorporate your feedback and revise the plan

I am pausing here and will wait for your response before continuing.
```

## Critical Requirements

- ✅ **DO be specific** - clearly state what you're requesting approval for
- ✅ **DO provide context** - explain why this needs approval
- ✅ **DO assess impact** - help the user make an informed decision
- ✅ **DO give options** - make it easy to approve, reject, or provide feedback
- ✅ **DO explicitly pause** - make it clear you're waiting for input
- ❌ **DO NOT proceed** - never assume approval and continue automatically
- ❌ **DO NOT be vague** - "is this okay?" is not sufficient
- ❌ **DO NOT skip details** - provide all information needed for decision

## System Integration

When you complete this subroutine:

1. The system detects your approval request format
2. An **elicitation** is posted to Linear with an authorization button
3. The user clicks the button to approve (or provides feedback in Linear)
4. The workflow resumes with the next subroutine (or stays here if feedback given)

## Context Variables

The system will provide context about what approval is being requested for based on the procedure configuration. Use that context to tailor your approval request appropriately.

## Examples

### Example 1: Debugging Reproduction Approval

```markdown
# Bug Reproduction Complete

## Summary
I've identified the root cause of the authentication timeout bug and created a failing test case.

## Details

### Root Cause
The session cookie expiration check is using server time instead of UTC, causing timezone-dependent failures...

### Reproduction Steps
1. Set server timezone to UTC+8
2. Create a session at 11:00 PM local time
3. Wait 2 hours
4. Attempt to access protected route
5. Expected: Session valid (1 hour old in UTC)
6. Actual: Session expired (appears 3 hours old due to timezone)

### Failing Test Case
- File: `tests/auth/session-expiry.test.ts`
- Test name: "should handle cross-timezone session expiration"
- Status: ✅ Test created and failing as expected

## Impact Assessment
- **Scope**: Authentication module only
- **Risk**: Low - fix is isolated to date comparison logic
- **Effort**: ~30 minutes to implement + verify
- **Reversibility**: High - simple code change

## Recommendation
Proceed with implementing the fix by normalizing all date comparisons to UTC.

---

**🔴 APPROVAL REQUIRED**

Please review the above findings and approve to proceed with implementing the fix.
```

### Example 2: Architecture Approval

```markdown
# Proposed Architecture Change: Event-Driven Notifications

## Summary
Requesting approval to refactor the notification system from polling to event-driven architecture.

## Details

### Current State
- Polling every 5 seconds (inefficient)
- High database load
- Delayed notifications

### Proposed Change
- WebSocket-based event stream
- Real-time notifications
- 80% reduction in DB queries

## Impact Assessment
- **Scope**: Notification system, WebSocket server, client components
- **Risk**: Medium - requires testing across browsers
- **Effort**: 2-3 days development + testing
- **Reversibility**: Medium - can rollback but requires redeployment

## Recommendation
Proceed with the refactor during the next sprint to reduce infrastructure costs.

---

**🔴 APPROVAL REQUIRED**

Please approve this architectural change or provide feedback on concerns.
```

## Remember

This is a **pause point** in the workflow. The system is designed to stop here and wait for user input. Your job is to present the information clearly and make it easy for the user to make a decision.
