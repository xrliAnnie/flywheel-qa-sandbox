# Problem Definition

Help the user define problems clearly before jumping to solutions using frameworks from 91 product leaders.

## How to Help

When the user asks for help with problem definition:

1. **Understand the current framing** - Ask how they're currently thinking about the problem
2. **Dig into the struggling moment** - Help them articulate the specific context where users feel stuck
3. **Separate problem from solution** - Ensure they haven't conflated a desired feature with the underlying need
4. **Validate the problem matters** - Help them confirm the problem is urgent and widespread enough to solve

## Core Principles

### Digitizing analog isn't enough
Bret Taylor: "Why use this instead of the Yellow Pages? It was a digital version of something that had come before." Simply digitizing an analog predecessor often fails because it lacks a native reason to exist on the new platform. Ask "why should a customer give this the time of day?"

### Prototype to define the problem
Jake Knapp + John Zeratsky: "This idea of getting unstuck and turning maybe some abstract ideas or some concepts that you've been discussing, turning that into a concrete prototype, something that you can look at and you can click around." Moving from abstract concepts to concrete prototypes is the fastest way to define and solve a problem.

### Avoid the shiny object trap
Marily Nika: "There is something called the shiny object trap, and I'm always telling people, 'Hey, don't do AI for the sake of doing AI.' Make sure there is a problem there." Ensure AI (or any new technology) is used to solve a specific, validated user pain point rather than for its own sake.

### Struggling moments cause demand
Bob Moesta: "A struggling moment causes demand. And you start to realize that in some cases that struggling moment exists and can exist for a long time and nobody solved it." Demand is created by a specific "struggling moment" in a user's life, not by the product itself. Study the context that makes users' behavior rational.

### See the end from the beginning
Ryan Singer: "We are not going to start something unless we can see the end from the beginning. We're not going to take a big concept and then say, 'What's the estimate for this thing?'" Ensure the team can visualize the completed feature before committing resources. Avoid starting with fuzzy concepts.

### The solution is what customers buy
Marty Cagan: "People don't buy the problem, they buy your solution. Obviously they don't buy it if it's not solving something they care about, but there are many products that are solving what they care about." While understanding the problem is necessary, competitive advantage comes from the quality of the solution. Don't over-rotate on problem validation if the problem is well-understood.

### Spend more time on the problem
Christopher Lochhead: "Spend more time on the problem than the solution." Deeply understanding the customer's perspective of the problem is more valuable than internal product brainstorming. Listen to hear their perspective rather than just pitching your solution.

### Qualify the problem type
Christopher Miller: "I don't know that we even talk about problems without a qualifier. Are we talking about a business problem? Are we talking about a customer problem?" Effective problem definition requires distinguishing between business needs and customer pain points to avoid "customer-hostile" solutions.

## Questions to Help Users

- "What is the user doing right before they encounter this problem? What are they trying to accomplish?"
- "Why hasn't this problem been solved already? What makes it hard?"
- "Is this a business problem or a customer problem? Are they the same?"
- "If you solved this problem perfectly, how would the user's life be different?"
- "Can you describe a specific person experiencing this problem in a specific moment?"
- "What are people doing today to work around this problem?"

## Common Mistakes to Flag

- **Solution-first thinking** - Starting with a feature idea and working backward to justify it
- **Technology-first thinking** - Wanting to use AI/blockchain/etc. and looking for problems to apply it to
- **Abstract problem statements** - Defining problems so broadly they don't point to any specific solution
- **Conflating business and customer problems** - Solving for internal metrics without addressing user needs
- **Skipping the struggling moment** - Not understanding the specific context where pain occurs

## Adriel Frederick
*Adriel Frederick*

> "I went from wanting to curse Rick out for making me drive 15 minutes to come pick him up to feeling like, all right, no, no, no, there's real value I'm providing you in driving him just two minutes. But I recognized that wasn't embedded in the structure of paying."

**Insight:** Directly experiencing the product as a user or provider reveals fundamental flaws in problem definition that metrics might obscure.

**Tactical advice:**
- Engage in 'dogfooding' in the real world (e.g., driving for the service) to understand the friction points of your users.
- Look for cases where the product provides value but the business model fails to capture or compensate for it.

> "For me, it's a person who is just on the cusp of taking the action you want to take... I like to go to the worst. It shows me everything that's wrong, but the marginal user thinking helps you prioritize what thing to do next."

**Insight:** Focusing on the 'marginal user'—the person most likely to succeed but currently failing—is the most effective way to prioritize friction removal.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify the 'worst-case' user (e.g., low-end device, poor connection) to see all product flaws simultaneously.
- Prioritize fixes for the marginal user by removing barriers that are within your immediate control to resolve.

## Aishwarya Naresh Reganti + Kiriti Badam
*Aishwarya Naresh Reganti + Kiriti Badam*

> "In all this advancements of the AI... one easy, slippery slope is to keep thinking about complexities of the solution and forget the problem that you're trying to solve. When you're trying to start at a smaller scale of autonomy, you start to really think about what is the problem that I'm trying to solve and how do I break it down into levels of autonomy that I can build later?"

**Insight:** AI development often fails when teams focus on technical complexity instead of clearly defining and breaking down the core customer problem.

**Tactical advice:**
- Break down complex problems into progressive levels of autonomy.
- Resist the urge to build high-complexity solutions before the problem is fully understood.

*Timestamp: 00:20:08*

> "80% of so called AI engineers, AIPMs spend their time actually understanding their workflows very well. They're actually in the weeds understanding their customer's behavior and data. And whenever a software engineer who's never done AI before, here's the term, look at your data. I think it's a huge revelation to them, but it's always been the case."

**Insight:** The majority of AI product work is deep workflow analysis and data investigation rather than model building.

**Tactical advice:**
- Spend significant time 'in the weeds' analyzing existing customer workflows and data before building.
- Map out hierarchical taxonomies and edge cases in enterprise data that might confuse an agent.

*Timestamp: 01:14:25*


## Amjad Masad
*Amjad Masad*

> "I asked RPM at Replit, Aman Mathur who's a fan of the show to tell me what PMs like to build. And so he came up with a prompt. He kind of really crafted a great prompt... basically, what we're asking for is we want to build a web application... for product managers to track feature requests on a public dashboard."

**Insight:** Effective problem definition in the AI era involves crafting highly descriptive prompts that outline specific user roles, features, and desired outcomes.

**Tactical advice:**
- Define the specific tech stack (e.g., Node.js).
- List core features clearly (e.g., voting system, status tracking).
- Specify user personas (e.g., public dashboard for community, admin controls for PMs).

*Timestamp: 00:12:11*


## Anuj Rathi
*Anuj Rathi*

> "Don't think about agentic user. Let's say Lenny, 30 years old, doing A, B, C things... His relationship with this category of food delivery is X. These are the things that he has done in the last month. In the last three days, there were the needs, desires, aspirations, fears, frustrations, et cetera, et cetera. We say, 'Okay. It's 11:00. What's happened? Why is this user open, or what triggered this particular app, and then what happened?'"

**Insight:** Move beyond generic personas to 'persons' by recreating exact, high-fidelity scenarios of a specific individual's life and emotional state.

**Tactical advice:**
- Plot out the user's emotional state during 'waiting' periods (e.g., the 30 minutes after ordering food).
- Create a 'wall' that shows the entire end-to-end journey including marketing triggers and every pixel of the UI.

*Timestamp: 00:34:16*


## Annie Pearl
*Annie Pearl*

> "We have a meeting called OPA, which stands for opportunity/problem, assessment. And so, what this is, it's a meeting where basically PMs... debate and discuss with each other and spar around either areas and problems that they want to go investigate or after they've gotten data back or research back from evaluating an opportunity."

**Insight:** A dedicated 'Opportunity/Problem Assessment' (OPA) meeting allows PMs to peer-review and spar over problem spaces before committing to solutions.

**Tactical advice:**
- Create a safe space for PMs to debate problems without senior leadership judgment.
- Use OPA meetings to decide whether to move from investigation to solution development.

*Timestamp: 00:46:12*


## Anton Osika
*Anton Osika*

> "Explaining exactly what you expect and what you're not getting is even more important with AI than with the humans. So I'm going into hooking up more of the actual functionality, but first I'll actually show you something. What's the fastest way to change what went wrong, it's created buttons that say book now and I want them to say, 'Buy now.'"

**Insight:** Effective product building with AI requires precise articulation of expectations and specific identification of what is failing.

**Tactical advice:**
- Avoid vague feedback like 'it doesn't work'
- Clearly define the delta between expected and actual results

*Timestamp: 00:14:39*

---

> "The big learning is that you have to start with how is this product working end-to-end and then add AI or think where should we add AI? So that was a big learning for me that you really want to see what does the big picture of the user, what's the big picture of how do you think the user experience should be?"

**Insight:** Avoid retrofitting AI into existing products; instead, start with the end-to-end user problem and determine where AI provides the most value.

**Tactical advice:**
- Define the end-to-end user experience before selecting AI tools
- Avoid 'novelty' AI features that don't solve a core user pain point

*Timestamp: 01:03:49*


## Aparna Chennapragada
*Aparna Chennapragada*

> "I've repeatedly learned that when you're doing something new, zero-to-one, the temptation is to kind of think about... go to scale before solve. So I've always said to my teams solve before scale. So what that does mean is there's a different posture and different mode when you're trying to solve a problem versus scaling something that's either post-product market fit or even at least in roughly in the ballpark."

**Insight:** In the zero-to-one phase, teams must prioritize solving the core problem and embracing 'chaos' before attempting to scale.

**Tactical advice:**
- Adopt a 'solve before scale' mindset for new products
- Be comfortable with wide pivots and 'chaos' during the discovery phase
- Avoid prematurely fixing on a 'local hill' or specific solution before the problem is solved

*Timestamp: 00:37:57*


## Ayo Omojola
*Ayo Omojola*

> "You can't stop until you get to the end... so much value is lost when the person in the execution role isn't really in command of all the details... you can't avoid the details, you just have to get into them."

**Insight:** True problem definition requires a 'first principles' deep dive into technical and regulatory details rather than relying on general expert opinions.

**Tactical advice:**
- Ask 'tedious' questions about data fields and database null values to find hidden optimizations.
- Re-measure and re-instrument metrics from scratch when starting an optimization project.
- Challenge 'expert' advice by asking for the specific contractual or regulatory consequence of a decision.

*Timestamp: 35:08*


## Austin Hay
*Austin Hay*

> "PPS framework that I talk about a lot, which is problem, people and system. So, whenever there's a challenge that comes up... I like to first say what's the problem? Who are the people involved and what system does it impact? Usually because people just jump straight to the system."

**Insight:** Effective problem solving requires a sequence: define the problem, identify the stakeholders, and only then design the system.

**Tactical advice:**
- When a request for a tool comes in, pause and ask 'What is the discrete issue you are trying to solve?'
- Identify all people impacted by a potential system change before implementing it.

*Timestamp: 01:06:42*


## Bangaly Kaba
*Bangaly Kaba*

> "First you have to really understand from first principles what is actually going on. So understand, identify, execute. So when we talk about understand work, there's a few ways to think about it. One is, it is an intentional affordance in your execution to do the work that helps you to de-risk a project and to learn what's going on."

**Insight:** Explicitly allocate time in the roadmap for 'understand work' to de-risk projects and increase the success rate of execution.

**Tactical advice:**
- Create parallel paths in every sprint: execution for high-conviction items and 'understand work' for de-risking future items.
- Include cross-functional partners (marketing, GTM, data science) in 'understand work' to identify hidden gaps.

*Timestamp: 00:28:27*


## Bob Baxley
*Bob Baxley*

> "I try to encourage the product managers to what's the problem with the thing? And then let us solve it. Don't jump to it and tell us... Don't tell us this is just exactly what we're supposed to do."

**Insight:** Product managers should provide the 'script' (problem and constraints) rather than the 'sketch' (UI solution).

**Tactical advice:**
- Avoid drawing specific UI solutions for designers; instead, define the 'basketball court' of constraints they should operate within.

*Timestamp: 01:11:36*


## Benjamin Lauzier
*Benjamin Lauzier*

> "We connect people with complex conditions... with their own health advocate... we want to close the gap between patients and the healthcare system. There's this critical layer of the system that's missing, I think, people are navigating life-threatening or debilitating conditions largely with Google."

**Insight:** A strong problem definition identifies a 'missing layer' in a complex system (like healthcare) where users are currently forced to rely on inadequate tools (like Google).

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify where users feel 'alone' or 'isolated' despite interacting with a professional system.
- Look for systemic gaps where practitioners are overworked and cannot provide the advocacy users need.

*Timestamp: 01:14:12*


## Bob Moesta
*Bob Moesta*

> "But the real thing that if you start to study causality is that a struggling moment causes demand. And you start to realize that in some cases that struggling moment exists and can exist for a long time and nobody solved it."

**Insight:** Demand is created by a specific 'struggling moment' in a user's life, not by the product itself.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify the specific context that makes a user's seemingly irrational behavior rational.
- Focus on 'context and outcomes' rather than just 'pain and gain'.

*Timestamp: 00:07:44*

---

> "And so that's what we mean when we're customer-centric is that we're studying the struggling moments they have and people like Intercom and Basecamp, they look at struggling moments and that becomes their roadmap."

**Insight:** True customer-centricity involves documenting and solving for the specific moments where users feel stuck.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use struggling moments as the primary input for the product roadmap.

*Timestamp: 00:09:06*


## Bill Carr
*Bill Carr*

> "The first two things are the things that are hardest to define, like who's the customer? ... Then what is the specific problem you were solving? Ideally, you would some way have quantify that problem or there's some data or customer insights that have led you to understand that problem, to know that it is a meaningful and big problem."

**Insight:** A successful product requires a precise definition of the customer and a quantified understanding of their problem.

**Tactical advice:**
- Define the specific customer segment (e.g., which types of restaurants in which cities)
- Quantify the problem to ensure it is meaningful enough for customers to pay for a solution

*Timestamp: 00:43:08*

---

> "I would argue this is a case where we made the mistake of what we had a technology solution in mind, which was 3D effects. And then we took that solution and we're then in search of a problem. I don't think it solved any meaningful problems for customers."

**Insight:** Avoid 'technology-first' solutions; if a product fails despite good execution, it usually means it didn't solve a real customer problem.

**Tactical advice:**
- Audit failed products by asking: 'What specific customer problem did this solve?'

*Timestamp: 01:05:36*


## Brian Tolkin
*Brian Tolkin*

> "The canonical version of it encourages you to think about the context in which the user's operating or the other things outside of your product that they might be going through."

**Insight:** Use the Jobs to Be Done framework to map the user's entire journey, including offline actions and conversations that happen outside of your software.

**Tactical advice:**
- Define the problem within the broader context of the user's life (e.g., moving houses, not just getting an offer)
- Distinguish between business goals (getting an offer) and true customer jobs (price discovery)

*Timestamp: 00:31:54*

---

> "Product is finding the kernel of truth in a sea of ambiguity and signals... what is noise? What is a good idea, what is a suggestion and what is back to the jobs to be done for what is really going to move the customer forward?"

**Insight:** The core of product management is filtering through massive amounts of feedback to find the single most impactful problem to solve.

**Tactical advice:**
- Filter feedback through the lens of 'what will move the customer forward'
- Be comfortable saying no to good ideas that aren't the 'kernel' of the problem

*Timestamp: 00:56:33*


## Camille Hearst
*Camille Hearst*

> "I think with any company, solving a real problem is the most important thing. So creators have lots of challenges and things that can be solved... I think at the core, every creator needs two things. They need to grow an audience and they need to get paid so that they can make a living."

**Insight:** Successful creator platforms must solve the two fundamental pain points: audience growth and sustainable monetization.

**Tactical advice:**
- Prioritize features that directly impact audience growth or payment reliability

*Timestamp: 00:46:24*


## Brian Chesky
*Brian Chesky*

> "We asked ourselves, what if we could combine the uniqueness of Airbnb with the reliability that you've come to expect in a hotel? And that's what we've done with Guest Favorites... we use all the signal to create the top two million homes."

**Insight:** Identify the core weakness of your product (e.g., reliability) and design features specifically to bridge that gap with competitors.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify the 'Achilles heel' of the product through user research
- Use data signals like reviews and cancellations to categorize quality

*Timestamp: 00:39:00*


## Bret Taylor
*Bret Taylor*

> "It was a digital version of something that had come before... why use this instead of the Yellow Pages? But more than anything else, why use this instead of the Yellow Pages? It was a digital version of something that had come before."

**Insight:** Simply digitizing an analog predecessor often fails because it lacks a native reason to exist on the new platform.

**Tactical advice:**
- Ask 'why should a customer give this the time of day?' compared to the non-digital alternative
- Avoid 'me-too' products that just copy existing digital incumbents

*Timestamp: 00:06:54*

---

> "The original framing was one click comment... we needed a one-click comment. That's where the concept came from."

**Insight:** The 'Like' button was born from defining the problem as 'removing low-value one-word comments' to improve discussion quality.

**Tactical advice:**
- Define the core friction point (e.g., 'one-word comments') before designing the solution

*Timestamp: 01:25:48*

---

> "Competing Against Luck, which was the book that produced Jobs to be Done, which is a framework I really believe in."

**Insight:** The Jobs to be Done framework is essential for understanding the underlying need a customer is 'hiring' a product to fulfill.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use the Jobs to be Done framework to identify the functional and emotional needs of the user

*Timestamp: 01:21:59*


## Chip Huyen
*Chip Huyen*

> "Go look from the last week. For a week, just pay attention to what you do and what frustrates you. And when something frustrates you, think about, is there anything we can do? Can it be done a different way?"

**Insight:** The best AI product ideas come from identifying personal or workflow frustrations rather than looking for a technology-first solution.

**Tactical advice:**
- Audit your own frustrations for one week to find 'micro-tool' opportunities
- Ask 'how can this be better?' every time a task feels repetitive or annoying

*Timestamp: 01:10:27*


## Christian Idiodi
*Christian Idiodi*

> "I said, there's nothing better in learning how to solve a problem than trying to solve the problem. You will get all the answers, the research, the failure, the mistakes, all the evidence. You know the difference between what people say, this is what they do."

**Insight:** The most effective way to define and understand a problem is to attempt to solve it manually and observe the results in the real world.

**Tactical advice:**
- Get out of the building and immerse yourself in the environment where the problem exists.
- Perform the service manually (using spreadsheets or phones) before building any software to validate the problem space.
- Recruit users who are 'evangelists'—people so desperate for a solution they will try anything.

*Timestamp: 00:46:34*


## Chandra Janakiraman
*Chandra Janakiraman*

> "The first step is really generating a whole bunch of problems... You start the day with, 'Hey, let's collect everybody's thoughts on what the problems are that are holding us back.'"

**Insight:** Effective strategy begins with a raw, uninhibited collection of the obstacles preventing growth or user satisfaction.

**Tactical advice:**
- Conduct a free-flowing problem generation session with the working group
- Cluster related problems into 10-15 distinct groups
- Flip problem clusters into positive 'opportunity framings' (e.g., 'difficulty finding things' becomes 'discovery')

*Timestamp: 00:32:59*


## Chip Conley
*Chip Conley*

> "Isn't the product the homes and the apartments? Jobot said, 'Nope. Product in the tech industry is something different.'"

**Insight:** In tech, the 'product' is often the digital interface and platform, but for the user, the product is the real-world experience.

**Tactical advice:**
- Challenge internal definitions of 'product' to ensure they align with the actual customer experience

*Timestamp: 00:00:32*


## Christopher Lochhead
*Christopher Lochhead*

> "Problems create categories, and you either have to A, solve a new problem, or B, reframe, name and claim an existing problem in a... very different way. And if you reframe the existing problem such that people see it in a different way, that's when they'll be open to a new solution."

**Insight:** Category creation is rooted in either discovering a new problem or fundamentally changing how an existing problem is perceived.

**Tactical advice:**
- Reframe an existing problem to make people open to a new solution.
- Focus on the problem set before defining the solution set.

*Timestamp: 00:33:33*

---

> "Spend more time on the problem than the solution."

**Insight:** Deeply understanding the customer's perspective of the problem is more valuable than internal product brainstorming.

**Tactical advice:**
- Listen to customers to hear their perspective on the problem rather than just pitching your solution.

*Timestamp: 01:00:21*


## Christopher Miller
*Christopher Miller*

> "I don't know that we even talk about problems without a qualifier. Are we talking about a business problem? Are we talking about a customer problem? Are we talking about an efficiency problem? Describe the nature of the problem and parse it out."

**Insight:** Effective problem definition requires distinguishing between business needs and customer pain points to avoid 'customer-hostile' solutions.

**Tactical advice:**
- Always qualify the 'problem' in documentation (e.g., 'Customer Problem' vs. 'Business Problem')
- Ask 'why' repeatedly to find the customer problem that is causing a downstream business issue

*Timestamp: 00:38:42*


## Daniel Lereya
*Daniel Lereya*

> "PMs and the teams, many times, spending a lot of time at the problem area, before they think about the solution. The solution is not the case anymore. There are so many different solutions."

**Insight:** Deeply understanding the problem space reduces friction in solution discussions because the criteria for success are already aligned.

**Tactical advice:**
- Spend significant time defining the customer problem before brainstorming features
- Ensure the entire cross-functional team has a shared understanding of the 'opportunity'

*Timestamp: 00:19:55*


## Dalton Caldwell
*Dalton Caldwell*

> "Usually a successful pivot gets warmer instead of colder from what you're an expert at and somehow builds on what you learned on the prior idea. Right? ... A good pivot is like going home. It's warmer, it's closer to something that you're an expert at."

**Insight:** Successful pivots move toward the founder's area of expertise ('warmer') rather than away from it ('colder').

**Tactical advice:**
- When pivoting, look for problems that leverage your existing expertise or lessons from the previous failed idea
- Avoid pivoting into 'fashionable' spaces where you have no unique insight

*Timestamp: 00:14:45*


## Drew Houston
*Drew Houston*

> "If you think about the higher level job to be done, I was like, 'No, the real issue is that it's super hard to find my stuff, organize my stuff, share my stuff, and secure my stuff.' In the beginning that was like my stuff was my files... Now, the stuff is tabs in my browser, and cloud tools."

**Insight:** Define problems by the underlying 'job to be done' rather than the specific medium or technology of the moment.

**Tactical advice:**
- Re-evaluate core product missions as technology shifts (e.g., from files to browser tabs) to see if the human problem still exists.

*Timestamp: 01:12:36*


## Dharmesh Shah
*Dharmesh Shah*

> "one of the mistakes I think founders make is that, especially product oriented founders, is that we fall in love with the solution instead of falling in love with the actual problem"

**Insight:** Deeply defining the problem allows you to determine if a broad 'all-in-one' solution is actually necessary versus a single-feature tool.

**Tactical advice:**
- If the customer's problem is 'too many disconnected tools,' the solution must be broad, even if it violates the 'focus on one thing' rule.

*Timestamp: 00:54:37*


## Eeke de Milliano
*Eeke de Milliano*

> "Build for your best user, not your worst user... you shouldn't really be building for them. I think a really good example of this is onboarding processes... Really, you should just be building an onboarding process for the user who's going to jump into your product and get it immediately."

**Insight:** In early product development, optimize for the 'power user' or ideal customer rather than getting bogged down by edge cases or potential abuse.

**Tactical advice:**
- Focus onboarding flows on the user most likely to find immediate value
- Avoid over-engineering for 'abuse' or 'worst-case' users until the product has significant scale

*Timestamp: 00:45:45*


## Eli Schwartz
*Eli Schwartz*

> "Step one is the step that almost everyone misses on SEO, which is be the user. Try to understand who your user is... they had zero customer empathy for why people use the tool."

**Insight:** The foundation of a successful product or SEO strategy is deep customer empathy gained by actually using the product as a customer would.

**Tactical advice:**
- Force team members to use the product to solve a real task during onboarding
- Develop customer empathy before defining the marketing or product strategy

*Timestamp: 00:31:54*

---

> "If you can't answer the question about what is it that someone's going to do a search on, then don't do SEO because SEO is about appealing to that user."

**Insight:** SEO is only a viable channel if you can clearly define the specific problems or questions users are searching for that your product solves.

**Tactical advice:**
- Validate that there is a clear search intent or 'SEO journey' for your product before investing
- Avoid SEO if the product solves a problem users don't yet know they have

*Timestamp: 00:33:09*


## Eoghan McCabe
*Eoghan McCabe*

> "I and we would create frameworks for everything... we'd have really joined up considered strategy... we just love to draw diagrams so you can teach all that stuff."

**Insight:** Using first-principles frameworks and visual diagrams makes complex strategy teachable and consistent across the org.

**Tactical advice:**
- Develop custom frameworks to define the 'mechanism' of how a product or event works.
- Use whiteboards extensively to map out systems and strategies from first principles.

*Timestamp: 01:07:36*


## Eric Ries
*Eric Ries*

> "I convinced them, instead of paying three years and $18 million, so you don't make the thing, let's go take a brochure, take it to some customers... customers laughed them out of the room and it was nothing to do with anything they cared about."

**Insight:** Use low-fidelity artifacts like brochures to validate problem-solution fit before investing in expensive R&D.

**Tactical advice:**
- Create a high-quality brochure of the proposed product specifications
- Present the brochure to potential customers to test value propositions
- Identify 'leap of faith' assumptions before building

*Timestamp: 00:40:13*


## Eric Simons
*Eric Simons*

> "The hard part now is, now it's easy to build the thing. Now it's, 'What the hell should we build? Can we clearly articulate what it is we want to build?' And then, 'Can we just have the taste to know, is this right, is this correct?'"

**Insight:** As AI lowers the cost of construction, the primary value of product roles shifts to problem definition, clear articulation, and taste.

**Tactical advice:**
- Focus on developing 'taste' to judge the quality of AI-generated outputs
- Invest more time in clearly articulating the problem and the desired solution to the AI

*Timestamp: 00:54:54*


## Evan LaPointe
*Evan LaPointe*

> "The best exercise for a conscientious person especially to feel more open is to become obsessed with reverse engineering... to truly understand the inputs that generate that outcome."

**Insight:** Reverse engineering desired outcomes helps bridge the gap between abstract vision and pragmatic execution.

**Tactical advice:**
- Deconstruct a desired market outcome into the specific inputs required to generate it.
- Use reverse engineering to understand the second and third-order effects of a proposed solution.

> "They also leave the problem stage out. So the world that customers are living in prior to discovering you, which is a really critical, that context is unbelievably valuable, especially for marketing. So to delete that out of the equation is a big problem."

**Insight:** Understanding the 'problem stage'—the context and struggle a customer faces before seeking a solution—is essential for effective marketing and product strategy.

**Tactical advice:**
- Research the customer's life and environment before they discovered your solution
- Map the 'struggle phase' to understand the triggers for solution-seeking

## Gokul Rajaram
*Gokul Rajaram*

> "The best founders early on trust their engineering teams and product development teams to solve problems and more clearly present a problem to them and help them... Why should we build an iOS app, while the actual problem to solve is we want to increase the percentage of people using a service to five times a week versus two times a week."

**Insight:** Effective product leadership focuses on defining the problem and the desired behavior change rather than prescribing specific features or tactics.

**Tactical advice:**
- Present problems to the team rather than dictating solutions
- Measure success by changes in customer behavior rather than features shipped

## Hamel Husain & Shreya Shankar
*Hamel Husain & Shreya Shankar*

> "Start with some kind of data analysis to ground what you should even test... you should start with some kind of data analysis to ground what you should even test."

**Insight:** Effective testing requires grounding in actual observed errors rather than theoretical assumptions.

**Tactical advice:**
- Perform error analysis before writing any automated tests
- Identify the 'most upstream error' in a sequence to define the core problem

*Timestamp: 00:10:06*


## Guillermo Rauch
*Guillermo Rauch*

> "Focus more on the product description, focus more on what do you want the end user to experience? What do you want the product to do? And try to be open-minded about how well the tool can implement it."

**Insight:** When building with AI, the human's value shifts from implementation to high-fidelity problem definition and experience design.

**Tactical advice:**
- Prioritize describing the desired user experience over technical implementation steps.
- Be prescriptive about the 'what' and 'why' while remaining flexible on the 'how'.

*Timestamp: 00:37:50*


## Gustaf Alstromer
*Gustaf Alstromer*

> "You can't actually ask them how difficult is it to do X, y, z because they won't even know that it's that difficult to them. So the best thing I've learned about how to discover the pain is to watch people, have them screen share, have them walk you through their daily workflow."

**Insight:** True problem definition comes from identifying inefficiencies that users are too close to see themselves.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify 'pain' by watching for manual workarounds or repetitive tasks in a user's day

*Timestamp: 00:33:43*


## Hari Srinivasan
*Hari Srinivasan*

> "How you can prioritize a list of ideas against a pain point... how to look through what's an acute pain point and what's a wide range of people use, how we'd expect data in order to be used in order to validate this."

**Insight:** Validate product ideas by distinguishing between intense, 'acute' pain points and those affecting a broad audience.

**Tactical advice:**
- Look for 'duct tape' solutions where users are manually hacking a fix to prove a problem exists
- Evaluate problems based on the intersection of pain intensity and user reach

*Timestamp: 00:47:19*


## Inbal S
*Inbal S*

> "It's really working backwards from the customer problem from what we're trying to solve, and then realize what are the best tools that we have in order to do that work better and think through that landscape versus, oh, AI is here, we have to use it."

**Insight:** Effective product development starts with a clear problem definition rather than a technology-first approach.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify manual workflows or configuration-heavy tasks as the primary problems to solve
- Resist the urge to 'plaster AI' on features without a clear problem-solution fit

*Timestamp: 14:38*


## Jake Knapp + John Zeratsky
*Jake Knapp + John Zeratsky*

> "This idea of getting unstuck and turning maybe some abstract ideas or some concepts that you've been discussing, turning that into a concrete prototype, something that you can look at and you can click around and you can actually try. It works in a lot of different contexts."

**Insight:** Moving from abstract concepts to concrete prototypes is the fastest way to define and solve a problem.

**Tactical advice:**
- Convert abstract discussions into a clickable prototype to gain clarity.
- Use prototypes to find out if you are on the right track before spending months on development.

*Timestamp: 01:29:07*

---

> "The first phase, the basics, as I mentioned, that's identifying who's your customer, what problem are you solving for the customer?"

**Insight:** The foundation of any project requires explicit alignment on the specific customer and the problem being solved before moving to solutions.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify the most important customer first.
- Define the specific problem the customer is facing that the product intends to solve.

*Timestamp: 00:15:04*

---

> "I think that problem can be really interesting because when teams sit down and think about it, it is often less clear than they thought what the actual problem is."

**Insight:** Teams often assume they are aligned on the problem, but individual perspectives usually vary significantly when written down.

**Tactical advice:**
- Have each team member write down the problem independently to reveal misalignments.

*Timestamp: 00:25:06*


## Jason Droege
*Jason Droege*

> "I look at the underlying incentives of the customer. And the underlying incentives of customers are not always financial. Sometimes it's ego, sometimes it's career growth. If you're selling enterprise software to someone, there's an executive sponsor as an example, that person needs to trust that you're going to do a good job for them."

**Insight:** Effective problem definition requires understanding the personal and professional incentives of the buyer, not just the business problem.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify the executive sponsor's personal incentives (e.g., career growth, trust)
- Align the product's value proposition with the buyer's internal urgency

*Timestamp: 00:42:33*

---

> "We ordered just a bunch of food from these places, and we got a restaurant supplier to give us a base catalog, and we just matched up how much does the ham weigh? How much does the cheese weigh? How much does the bread weigh?... we tried to actually just compose our own independent view of what's the ingredients cost versus what's the labor cost?"

**Insight:** To define a problem accurately, triangulate 'ground truth' data independently rather than relying solely on what customers tell you.

**Tactical advice:**
- Perform 'bottom-up' research to understand customer unit economics (e.g., weighing ingredients)
- Compare independent data against customer claims to find hidden insights

*Timestamp: 00:44:28*


## Jason Shah
*Jason Shah*

> "Understanding and defining what problem matters is the most important skill that I think I've taken away, and it applies to so many things. It can apply to a specific product we're building. It can apply to what a company's mission is. I think I've found it really effective because it affects pretty much everything."

**Insight:** The most foundational PM skill is identifying which specific problem is the most important to solve, as this dictates strategy, business models, and team motivation.

**Tactical advice:**
- Ask 'what problem are we solving?' to resolve debates between different product features or technical abstractions.
- Use the problem definition to guide business model decisions (e.g., free vs. paid based on the target user's constraints).

*Timestamp: 01:03:59*


## Jeremy Henrickson
*Jeremy Henrickson*

> "Go and see. Right? So to look at the thing and then walk all the way to ground and talk with the engineer who's writing the code on the thing. Because inevitably this top-level communication is insufficient to get to the detail of what matters and doesn't matter."

**Insight:** True understanding of a problem requires 'going to ground' and engaging with the lowest level of execution.

**Tactical advice:**
- Talk directly to the engineers writing the code to understand the reality of the project
- Don't rely solely on top-level status updates which often miss critical details

*Timestamp: 00:32:27*

---

> "The person with the product thing has to get into those same weeds first to really understand it... what's the point of writing a document if you don't know what you're talking about?"

**Insight:** Product managers must become domain experts by studying primary sources (like tax laws) rather than delegating all research to specialists.

**Tactical advice:**
- Study the 'textbooks' or primary regulations of your domain personally
- Spend at least half your time becoming a world expert in the product's specific details

*Timestamp: 00:36:55*


## Jiaona Zhang
*Jiaona Zhang*

> "we're going to be focused on users and people in the real world and their problems. And the first step is to understand their problems and then understand if there's an opportunity here as opposed to, 'Hey, you want to build X thing for Y person.' So that's the biggest mistake that you really have to unteach and retrain thinking around."

**Insight:** Avoid the common mistake of jumping to solutions by prioritizing deep user research and problem validation before defining the product.

**Tactical advice:**
- Focus on users and real-world problems before thinking about implementation
- Identify the opportunity space before committing to a specific startup or feature idea
- Untrain the instinct to lead with 'I want to build X'

*Timestamp: 00:05:16*


## John Cutler
*John Cutler*

> "There's the people like Teresa Torres and others that have come up with a technique that is universal. You can teach an element of product thinking with her techniques or this opportunity solution tree or this continuous discovery thing that everyone can find accessible no matter where your company is at."

**Insight:** Universal techniques like Opportunity Solution Trees provide a standardized way to define problems and explore solutions regardless of company size.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use Opportunity Solution Trees to map high-level goals to specific customer problems and potential solutions.

*Timestamp: 01:06:58*


## Julie Zhuo
*Julie Zhuo*

> "The most important feedback I would say is focus on identifying the problem and making it really clear for the other person, the person you're giving feedback to, what is the problem... instead of actually stating the reason, we go straight to the solution."

**Insight:** Effective feedback identifies the underlying problem rather than prescribing a specific solution, which empowers the designer to solve it.

**Tactical advice:**
- When giving feedback, state the 'why' behind your reaction (e.g., 'This is unclear because...')
- Avoid jumping straight to solutions like 'move this button' or 'change this color'

*Timestamp: 00:55:23*


## Kayvon Beykpour
*Kayvon Beykpour*

> "I was not a fan of how we leveraged jobs-to-be-done at Twitter. I thought it was exhausting and not particularly helpful... every framework at its limit is followed to such a religious extent it's just unhelpful. You need to have nuance in how you leverage these frameworks."

**Insight:** Frameworks like Jobs-to-be-Done become counterproductive when followed religiously without common sense or nuance.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use JTBD to force customer-centric thinking, but don't let it become the sole governing principle of what to build.

*Timestamp: 00:47:31*


## Kunal Shah
*Kunal Shah*

> "I ask myself and my key reportees every month, we go around the table and ask ourselves, ”What are the hardest problems we solved last month?”... If you're a senior, what is the role of a senior person? You have to be the chief problem solver."

**Insight:** Seniority is defined by the complexity of problems solved rather than the volume of work or 'busyness.'

**Tactical advice:**
- Conduct a monthly audit of the hardest problems solved by leadership.
- Distinguish between 'displacement' (being busy) and solving high-impact, difficult problems.

*Timestamp: 00:53:42*


## Kristen Berman
*Kristen Berman*

> "the behavioral diagnosis, I'd say, it's like a journey map on steroids where you're really trying to map the steps that get people to the behavior change... we'll do a deck of 200, 300 slides of screenshots where it's just very detailed analysis of the steps that it takes to get to the behavior change."

**Insight:** A 'behavioral diagnosis' involves a hyper-detailed mapping of every micro-step and psychological barrier in a user journey.

**Tactical advice:**
- Create a detailed deck of screenshots for every step of a flow and overlay the specific psychologies (e.g., information aversion) driving or blocking the user.

*Timestamp: 48:07*


## Laura Schaffer
*Laura Schaffer*

> "When you're doing PLG and we're shifting from sales to PLG, we need to reset. We need to recognize that, again, this is sales, sales via the product. What does a good sales rep do when they're engaging? They understand what the problem is of the person in the space they're talking to."

**Insight:** Transitioning to Product-Led Growth requires a fundamental reset to understand the unique problems of the self-serve user.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify how the problems of self-serve users differ from enterprise sales prospects
- Map the specific psychological barriers (the 'bogeyman') for your target segment
- Start with the customer problem rather than just 'chopping up' an existing enterprise product for parts

*Timestamp: 01:00:58*


## Marily Nika
*Marily Nika*

> "There is something called the shiny object trap, and I'm always telling people, "Hey, don't do AI for the sake of doing AI." Make sure there is a problem there. Make sure there is a pain point that needs to be solved in a smart way."

**Insight:** Avoid the 'shiny object trap' by ensuring AI is used to solve a specific, validated user pain point rather than for its own sake.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify the problem and high-level solution before determining the implementation technology.
- Focus on the 'why' before the 'how' when integrating AI.

*Timestamp: 00:00:00*

---

> "It helps me create user segments in a fantastic way. It will think of user segments that your mind wouldn't even go there, it just wouldn't go there. And it will provide the motivations, it will provide the pinpoints and you just come up with ideas as you read it."

**Insight:** Generative AI can be used to brainstorm and expand on user personas, motivations, and pain points.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use ChatGPT to generate a list of potential user segments for a specific product category.
- Ask AI for the specific motivations and pain points of niche user groups to spark product ideas.

*Timestamp: 00:06:34*

---

> "I usually say that the generalist PM helps their team and their company build and ship the right product. But the AI PM helps their team or company solve the right problem."

**Insight:** The core value of an AI PM is identifying the specific problems that are best suited for machine learning solutions.

**Tactical advice:**
- Shift focus from 'shipping features' to 'solving problems' when working with data scientists.
- Evaluate if a problem has enough data behind user behavior to be improved with AI.

*Timestamp: 00:13:19*


## Marty Cagan
*Marty Cagan*

> "People don't buy the problem, they buy your solution. Obviously they don't buy it if it's not solving something they care about, but there are many products that are solving what they care about. The real question is, do you solve it better than everybody else so that they buy you? And that's where you need to take time. So this is more like the coaching I give the teams. I tell them, "Look, be careful. If you need to spend a little time on the problem, fine, but don't spend a lot of time because you need to save as much time as possible to come up with the winning solution.""

**Insight:** While understanding the problem is necessary, the competitive advantage and customer purchase decision come from the quality of the solution.

**Tactical advice:**
- Limit time spent on problem validation if the problem is already well-understood
- Allocate the majority of discovery time to finding a winning solution

*Timestamp: 00:00:00*

---

> "In a real product team, first of all, instead of being given a roadmap of prioritized features, they're given problems to solve. So it might be a customer problem. It could be a company problem, it's all fair, but they're problems to solve."

**Insight:** Empowered teams are defined by being assigned problems to solve rather than specific features to build.

**Tactical advice:**
- Request problems to solve from leadership instead of feature lists
- Focus on customer or company problems as the starting point for team work

*Timestamp: 00:08:58*

---

> "And a product team, an empowered product team, instead of being given a roadmap of features, they're given problems to solve. Now they're customer problems or they're business problems or both, but they're given a problem to solve."

**Insight:** Empowered teams are defined by their focus on solving specific customer or business problems rather than simply executing a feature roadmap.

**Tactical advice:**
- Shift from delivering a roadmap of output to solving a roadmap of problems.
- Measure success by whether the problem is solved, not whether the feature is shipped.

*Timestamp: 00:21:01*


## Melanie Perkins
*Melanie Perkins*

> "If people don't understand the problem then they can't understand or care about your solution. And so there was a lot of refinement on the way it was articulated."

**Insight:** A product's value is only understood if the problem it solves is articulated clearly before the solution is presented.

**Tactical advice:**
- Ensure the first few slides of any pitch or proposal focus entirely on the problem space
- Refine the problem statement based on where audiences (like investors) show confusion

*Timestamp: 00:29:10*


## Michael Truell
*Michael Truell*

> "Cursor kind of started as a solution search of a problem... It felt like the people that were working on the space maybe had a disconnect with us, and it felt like they weren't being sufficiently ambitious about where everything was going to go in the future, and how all of software creation was going to blow through these models."

**Insight:** Identifying a 'high ceiling' market where existing incumbents lack ambition is a powerful way to define a product's problem space.

**Tactical advice:**
- Look for gaps in ambition among existing players in a high-potential technology shift.
- Evaluate if the 'ceiling' of a technology is high enough to allow for significant leapfrogs.

*Timestamp: 00:13:05*


## Mike Maples Jr
*Mike Maples Jr*

> "We want to solve problems for desperate people... if a customer has the ability to do something other than what you do to solve their problem, they won't be crazy enough to do business with a startup."

**Insight:** Startups should define problems through the lens of customer desperation, where no viable alternative exists.

**Tactical advice:**
- Look for 'unmet needs' that are so painful the customer is willing to take a risk on a new company
- Avoid markets where customers have 'good enough' alternatives from incumbents

*Timestamp: 01:01:47*


## Nabeel S. Qureshi
*Nabeel S. Qureshi*

> "The mandate wasn't like, 'Hey, we need to upgrade our data infrastructure...' It was much more just like, 'Please help us accomplish this mission. This is the big thing.'"

**Insight:** Define problems in terms of high-level business missions (e.g., ramping up production) rather than technical requirements.

**Tactical advice:**
- Anchor product goals to the customer's primary business outcome (e.g., 'produce 4x more planes').
- Map technical data tables to human-understandable concepts (an 'ontology') to solve real-world problems.

*Timestamp: 00:33:42*


## Nancy Duarte
*Nancy Duarte*

> "They hired a Pixar illustrator to illustrate each scene as the team's like, okay, okay, they said this is her name. And they were like, okay, what happens? Her alarm goes off... They realized from this little walk in the shoes of their customer just this day in the life... that they needed to move as soon as possible to a mobile first strategy."

**Insight:** Storyboarding the customer journey frame-by-frame can reveal fundamental strategic flaws and help define the real problems to solve.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use a storyboard artist to visualize the end-to-to customer experience
- Walk through the 'day in the life' of the user to identify friction points

*Timestamp: 01:07:46*


## Nan Yu
*Nan Yu*

> "How extreme can you take it? You're designing a product. You're trying to come up with a solution. What's the most outrageous version of this along some trait? ... The biggest risk is you didn't see the right choice to begin with. You have these three choices and none of them were right. It's this fourth one that was over in this corner, but you didn't look in that corner."

**Insight:** Expand the search space for solutions by intentionally exploring extreme or 'outrageous' versions of a product trait.

**Tactical advice:**
- Temporarily throw away constraints like cost or practicality to see beyond default solutions.
- Build and test extreme versions (e.g., 'safest' vs. 'fastest') to find the ideal middle ground.

*Timestamp: 00:45:09*

---

> "You have to look at things from an angle that other people might not have seen and for me, and for us, it's the angle of where are the emotional hooks that you're experiencing as you go through your work day... Paul Graham has a word for this. He calls it schlep blindness."

**Insight:** Identify problems by looking for 'schlep blindness'—the repetitive, annoying tasks users have become numb to.

**Tactical advice:**
- Observe the rhythm of a user's feelings throughout the day to find hidden friction points.
- Look for manual workarounds (like custom spreadsheets) as signals for product opportunities.

*Timestamp: 00:34:27*


## Nicole Forsgren
*Nicole Forsgren*

> "Starting with what is your problem or what is your goal? I would say this is a bigger challenge than most people recognize or realize. 80% of the folks that I work with, this is their biggest problem. Even at executive levels, teams will have gone off for several months, and they're tackling something, and they'll come back with uncertainty, and they'll say like, "Well, you told me to improve developer experience.""

**Insight:** Most teams fail because they do not spend enough time being 'crisp' on the specific problem or goal they are trying to solve.

**Tactical advice:**
- Define exactly what you mean by broad terms like 'developer experience' (e.g., culture vs. friction in toolchains) before starting work.
- Ensure executives and teams are aligned on the specific direction to avoid months of wasted effort.

*Timestamp: 00:00:00*


## Nikita Bier
*Nikita Bier*

> "Look for latent demand where people are trying to obtain a particular value and going through a very distortive process. If you can actually crystallize what their motivation is, you can have this kind of intense adoption."

**Insight:** The best product opportunities exist where users are already hacking together suboptimal solutions to satisfy a deep motivation.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify 'distortive processes' users are currently using to achieve a goal
- Crystallize the core motivation and build a product that removes the friction from that specific process

*Timestamp: 00:00:43*


## Oji Udezue
*Oji Udezue*

> "The problem space and the solutions to the problems space is still a big driver of success in building software companies. What problem are you really solving? And if you believe that the problem space is key, so what problems will predict success?"

**Insight:** The choice of problem space is a primary predictor of startup success, often more so than the specific methodology used to build the company.

**Tactical advice:**
- Segment the market by department breadth (niche vs. everyone) and workflow frequency (daily vs. monthly).
- Focus on 'High NI' (High frequency niche) workflows as they are highly profitable and easier to enter than 'everyone' workflows.

*Timestamp: 00:05:03*

---

> "Pick a problem that is materially felt by your customers, pain points that steal their time, their energy, their money, their focus, the inability to afford their leisure. If you can solve those kinds of problems... it's a huge tailwind."

**Insight:** Solving 'sharp' problems provides a buffer for execution mistakes because customer obsession with the solution will carry the product.

**Tactical advice:**
- Draw the current average workflow for a customer and compare it to the workflow after using your software; look for 2X to 3X compression.
- Look for the 'whites of their eyes'—physical signs of excitement or pupils dilating when describing the problem solution.

*Timestamp: 00:24:59*


## Paul Adams
*Paul Adams*

> "For us with Jobs to be Done, it was a really good way of us centering on the customer problem, focusing on not getting distracted, basing it in good solid research informed insight, that told us the thing people are trying to do."

**Insight:** Jobs to be Done (JTBD) is most effective when used as a simple tool to maintain focus on the core customer problem rather than an academic exercise.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use JTBD to identify the 'trigger' and the 'energy' a customer has around a specific problem.

*Timestamp: 01:08:47*


## Pete Kazanjy
*Pete Kazanjy*

> "The way that I like to frame it to people is that you're a consultant that has a particular predilection for a given solution... ideally, through a series of questions, I'm going to reveal that to them that they're doing it probably not great. And then once I've revealed to them the fact, through this directed questioning, what's known as discovery, that they have this high magnitude problem..."

**Insight:** Sales is a consultative process of using discovery questions to help a prospect realize the magnitude of their own problem.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use 'directed questioning' to uncover hidden pain points
- Focus on revealing the cost and magnitude of the problem before presenting the solution
- Act as a consultant rather than a traditional 'seller'

*Timestamp: 00:33:44*


## Raaz Herzberg
*Raaz Herzberg*

> "I still did not exactly understand what we were going to build, which was confusing, because I was a product manager... At some point, it was like, "Okay, I have to ask. What exactly are we," like, In the details, right? Not in describing a big problem, in a high level, big potential approach to solving it, but what exactly are we doing here?"

**Insight:** Admitting a lack of understanding is a critical tool for identifying when a product vision is too 'fuzzy' to be executable.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use the phrase 'I don't understand' to force the team to move from high-level problem statements to specific technical details.
- Ensure the team is 'not confused' even if they might be 'wrong' about the direction.

*Timestamp: 00:10:10*


## Richard Rumelt
*Richard Rumelt*

> "All strategy is problem solving. It's a form of dealing with challenges... you're diagnosing the situation. You're trying to figure out what's going on here. What's the nature of reality that you're dealing with?"

**Insight:** The foundation of any strategy is a rigorous diagnosis of the current reality and the specific problem to be solved.

**Tactical advice:**
- Start the strategy process by asking 'What's going on here?' to form a diagnosis.
- Decide what to pay attention to and form hypotheses about how things connect.

*Timestamp: 00:08:31*

---

> "The crux in a climb is the hardest part... In business, the crux is the hardest part of the problem. And from the design point of view... there's usually a challenge... by focusing on the difficulty, we see a way around it."

**Insight:** Identifying the 'crux'—the most difficult part of a challenge—is the key to finding a strategic breakthrough.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify the single hardest part of your problem and focus your energy there.
- Ask 'What makes this hard?' repeatedly to uncover the true bottleneck.

*Timestamp: 01:03:21*


## Robby Stein
*Robby Stein*

> "I think a lot about this job to be done framework... you have to really be a student of causation. Why is someone using this product? What are they doing with it and what are they trying to get done with it?"

**Insight:** Deeply understanding the 'causation'—the specific reason a user 'hires' a product—is the foundation of building successful features.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use 'interrogations' to find the 'big hire' moment: where was the user, what were they doing, and what triggered the decision?
- Distinguish between utility jobs and emotional jobs (e.g., feeling connected vs. just sending a photo).

*Timestamp: 00:37:05*


## Ryan Hoover
*Ryan Hoover*

> "I used to write like a problem journal. Like just when things annoyed me or when things were like less efficient, I would write it down as like a note. And I didn't try to solve it. I didn't- didn't say, 'Oh, here's the solution.' I was just like, 'This is annoying.'"

**Insight:** A 'problem journal' helps separate the observation of friction from the rush to find a solution.

**Tactical advice:**
- Keep a log of daily annoyances or inefficiencies without immediately jumping to solutions.
- Immerse yourself in niche communities to observe recurring problem statements from others.

*Timestamp: 00:51:20*


## Ryan Singer
*Ryan Singer*

> "The first thing is we are not going to start something unless we can see the end from the beginning. We’re not going to take a big concept and then say, 'What’s the estimate for this thing?'"

**Insight:** Clarity on the final outcome is a prerequisite for starting any development work.

**Tactical advice:**
- Ensure the team can visualize the completed feature before committing resources.
- Avoid starting with 'fuzzy' concepts that haven't been sharpened into concrete ideas.

*Timestamp: 00:00:16*

---

> "We narrowed it down to we understand that for our specific customers who are requesting this again and again, it’s more about I need to see empty spaces and in the existing agenda view, I can only see things that are already scheduled and I can’t see free spaces where I could book something. So, we got to that point of what we’re trying to solve here is the empty spaces. So, that’s a good frame."

**Insight:** Effective problem definition involves 'framing' the issue to a specific, solvable pain point rather than a broad category.

**Tactical advice:**
- Narrow a broad feature request (like 'a calendar') down to the specific user struggle (like 'seeing empty spaces').
- Set boundaries on the problem to prevent scope creep during the shaping phase.

*Timestamp: 00:42:21*

---

> "The PM moves upstream... less busy with, 'How do I get this project to not be in a bad state when it’s getting built?' And they’re way more in, 'How do I understand the business context? How do I narrow down the problem? How do I negotiate back and forth with maybe the CPO who brought this to me to understand where the core of it is?'"

**Insight:** The primary value of a Product Manager is in the 'upstream' work of defining the problem and business value before building starts.

**Tactical advice:**
- Focus on the 'demand-side'—understanding the customer's struggling moment.
- Negotiate with stakeholders to find the most valuable 'slice' of a problem to solve.

## Seth Godin
*Seth Godin*

> "Empathy is not about kindness and empathy is not an option. This is something that you are making for other people. So the whole idea of RTFM, read the manual, I'm angry at you. If you're saying that to your customers, you made a mistake, they did not make a mistake."

**Insight:** True product empathy means taking full responsibility for the user's experience rather than blaming them for not understanding the product.

**Tactical advice:**
- Eliminate the 'blame the user' mentality within the product team.
- Design products that don't require a manual to be understood.

*Shishir Mehrotra*

> "The eigenquestion, the simplest definition of eigenquestion, it's the question that when answered also answers the most subsequent questions... Rank them by which ones would eliminate the most other questions of the list."

**Insight:** The most effective way to solve complex problems is to identify the 'eigenquestion'—the core question that, once answered, resolves many smaller, secondary questions.

**Tactical advice:**
- List all open questions and identify which one has the most 'leverage' over the others.
- Reframe tactical debates (e.g., 'should we link out?') into strategic eigenquestions (e.g., 'consistency vs. comprehensiveness?').

## Sri Batchu
*Sri Batchu*

> "I say that my love languages are spreadsheets and frameworks. And one very simple one... is what we call MECE, mutually exclusive, collectively exhausted set of things."

**Insight:** Using the MECE framework ensures that when defining a problem or solution space, you are being comprehensive and avoiding overlaps.

**Tactical advice:**
- Break down high-level problems (e.g., revenue slow down) into non-overlapping sub-variables
- Verify that the sum of your sub-variables 'collectively exhausts' the total problem space

*Timestamp: 01:07:46*


## Stewart Butterfield
*Stewart Butterfield*

> "If people could get over the idea of reducing friction as a number of goal or reducing the number of clicks or taps to do something, and instead focus on how can I make this simple? How do I prevent people from having to think in order to use my software?"

**Insight:** The core challenge of product design is often user comprehension and cognitive load rather than simply the number of steps in a process.

**Tactical advice:**
- Prioritize 'Don't Make Me Think' as a design mantra
- Focus on creating comprehension of 'what is this' and 'what do I do next' over friction reduction

*Timestamp: 00:01:05*

---

> "If your software stops me a second and asks me to make a decision and I don't really understand it, you make me feel stupid. ... if you're causing people to think, in the best case, it's unnecessary use of their biological resources, and in the worst case you've now made them feel bad, emotionally bad."

**Insight:** Unnecessary decision points in software create cognitive fatigue and negative emotional associations for the user.

**Tactical advice:**
- Minimize the number of decisions a user must make to achieve a goal
- Ensure every required decision is accompanied by clear comprehension of the impact

*Timestamp: 00:37:40*


## Sriram and Aarthi
*Sriram and Aarthi*

> "I hate Jobs-to-be-Done, I think it is a terrible framework, I think no successful company has ever been built on top of JTBD and if you pick JTBD, you're probably doomed"

**Insight:** JTBD is often too idealistic and fails to account for the complex trade-offs and multi-agent systems inherent in real-world product development.

**Tactical advice:**
- Avoid using JTBD for complex products with multiple user types and competing incentives.
- Focus on systems thinking rather than isolated user 'jobs'.

*Timestamp: 00:00:00*

---

> "The problem with that is it's just too idealistic. And most frameworks are, but this one just takes it up a notch where it's like it's almost meant for people who are so naive about product building and especially product building at scale."

**Insight:** JTBD may work for a V1 hypothesis but typically falls apart when scaling due to hard trade-offs.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use JTBD only for early-stage hypothesis testing, not for V2 or V3 scaling decisions.

*Timestamp: 01:13:07*


## Teresa Torres
*Teresa Torres*

> "I think that the heart of good product is really getting comfortable in the problem space or the opportunity space, really taking the time to frame a problem well, and to really get into what's needed before we jump to solutions."

**Insight:** Effective product management requires resisting the urge to jump to solutions and instead spending time deeply framing the problem space.

**Tactical advice:**
- Distinguish between the problem space and the solution space
- Avoid writing opportunities as solutions
- Use an experience map to structure the opportunity space based on the customer journey

*Timestamp: 07:26*

---

> "As you move vertically down the tree, your opportunities are getting smaller and smaller, which is really key to helping us unlock a continuous cadence... we can deconstruct it. Maybe I can't find something to watch because I don't know if this show's any good... Now we're getting into an opportunity that we can actually solve."

**Insight:** Deconstructing large, evergreen problems into smaller, specific opportunities makes them actionable for continuous delivery.

**Tactical advice:**
- Break down big problems into smaller sub-opportunities
- Frame opportunities specifically (e.g., 'hard to enter password with remote') rather than vaguely ('easier to use')

*Timestamp: 11:57*


## Todd Jackson
*Todd Jackson*

> "You've got the persona, the problem, the promise, and the product. Lattice kept the first one but changed the others. Vanta changed all four."

**Insight:** The 'Four Ps' framework (Persona, Problem, Promise, Product) is the core diagnostic tool for finding product-market fit.

**Tactical advice:**
- Ensure the problem you are solving is both 'important' and 'urgent' to the target persona.
- If stuck at Level 1, systematically evaluate which of the Four Ps needs to shift; often the problem isn't significant enough to drive a sale.

*Timestamp: 00:00:34*


## Uri Levine
*Uri Levine*

> "Fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love with the problem, and then actually what you're trying to do is engage everyone else to fall in love with the same problem, to go into this journey, into this path and follow your leadership there."

**Insight:** The core of entrepreneurship is value creation through solving a significant problem that others also experience.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify a big problem where the world becomes better if solved.
- Ensure you aren't the only person with the problem before building.

*Timestamp: 00:00:09*

---

> "When you fall in love with the problem, then what happened is that the problem is going to serve as the North Star of your journey, and when you have a North Star, you're going to make less deviation from the course and you are way more likely to become successful."

**Insight:** A well-defined problem acts as a strategic guide that prevents unnecessary deviations during the startup journey.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use the problem as a North Star to maintain focus.

*Timestamp: 00:04:06*

---

> "And what I really encourage people is first of all, go and validate the problem, speak with people, understand their perception of the problem. And only then start to think about the solution... when you focus on the problem, then the problem is going to serve as the north star of your journey. And when you have a north star, you're going to make less deviation from the course and increase the likelihood of being successful."

**Insight:** Focusing on the problem rather than the solution provides a strategic North Star that prevents unnecessary deviations and creates a more compelling narrative for customers.

**Tactical advice:**
- Validate the problem by speaking with people before designing any part of the solution.
- Look for 'emotional engagement'—if a potential customer says 'I hate that' about a problem, you have found a valid starting point.

*Timestamp: 01:04:50*


## Yuhki Yamashata
*Yuhki Yamashata*

> "A customer is asking for a feature, but then you would say, okay, why are they asking for it, and back up the problem. But I think there's one more step you can take, which is, why do they have that problem in the first place? And maybe there's something there, and that could be an opportunity to make a bigger product impact by fixing that underlying condition that created the problem in the first place."

**Insight:** PMs should own the 'why' by using techniques like the 'Five Whys' to uncover the root cause of a customer's request rather than just building the requested feature.

**Tactical advice:**
- Apply the 'Five Whys' technique to customer requests
- Focus on the underlying condition that created the problem
- Ensure the whole team understands the 'why' so they can make better local decisions

*Timestamp: 00:21:06*


## Brendan Foody
*Brendan Foody*

> "What matters a ton is actually figuring out what are the new markets, the new pockets of demand that are changing very quickly where the wealthiest customers in the world are willing to pay whatever it takes to improve model capabilities, and how do we focus on the leading indicators of those markets"

**Insight:** High-growth opportunities are found by identifying 'market vacuums' where customers have urgent, high-value problems and focusing on the leading indicators of those needs.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify 'pockets of demand' where customers are willing to pay a premium for solutions
- Focus on leading indicators of market change rather than lagging metrics

*Timestamp: 00:40:18*

---

> "What you actually need to find is the customer that's surprisingly easy to sell into where you're going to be able to grow with them. You know that it's a large pain point."

**Insight:** True product-market fit is signaled by customers who are 'surprisingly easy to sell into,' indicating a massive, unaddressed pain point.

**Tactical advice:**
- Look for customers where the sales process is frictionless as a signal of high pain
- Be open-minded about the specific form your solution takes based on market pull

*Timestamp: 00:44:35*


## Dylan Field
*Dylan Field*

> "I like art applied to problem solving because I think that design is often... There is some component of creativity to it and unique expression that you're trying to provide and create and put out into the world. But you are also trying to do it and match it to a user need, a problem that needs to be solved. And I think that it's not pure art, but if you lose the art and you're just solving the problem, it's totally utilitarian and it lacks soul."

**Insight:** Effective problem definition in design requires balancing utilitarian solutions with creative expression to avoid 'soulless' products.

**Tactical advice:**
- Match creative expression directly to a specific user need
- Ensure the solution isn't just solving the problem but also provides a unique, creative experience

*Timestamp: 07:09*


## Garrett Lord
*Garrett Lord*

> "They really care about, to zoom out, they care about three things. They care about quality first and foremost... And then, the other huge problems you have is volume... And then, the other thing I would say model builders care about is speed."

**Insight:** The core problem for AI labs is the 'trilemma' of needing high-quality data at massive volumes with extreme speed.

**Tactical advice:**
- Optimize data pipelines to turn around experiments in a matter of days
- Build internal research teams to approximate the gain of each unit of data before delivery

*Timestamp: 00:20:48*


## Ebi Atawodi
*Ebi Atawodi*

> "the tactical thing that I almost make every PM on my team do I call it top 10 things you should know. It's a living document... 10 problems you should know. And you revise it. Every quarter you update it and they're separate. So it's like a living set of problems. And they could be qualitative, they could be quantitative, they could be tech debt."

**Insight:** Maintaining a living document of the top 10 problems ensures the team is always aligned on the most critical issues to solve.

**Tactical advice:**
- Create a living 'Top 10 Things You Should Know' document for your product area
- Update the problem list quarterly with a mix of qualitative, quantitative, and technical debt issues

*Timestamp: 00:33:27*

---

> "I'll sometimes bring them in at the beginning of the strategy session and give them a template, 10 things you should know. So you use my framework to give me 10 problems. Because if you say, 'Come present,' they'll do like 50 slides. No, that's just 10 things you should know and stack rank them."

**Insight:** Using a strict template for stakeholders prevents rambling presentations and forces them to prioritize their needs.

**Tactical advice:**
- Ask stakeholders to provide exactly 10 stack-ranked problems using a standard template before strategy sessions

*Timestamp: 00:38:59*


## Naomi Gleit
*Naomi Gleit*

> "I often go into a project, everyone's operating at a PhD level, I'm coming in at a kindergarten level... identifying the most basic building blocks of a complex problem and then unfolding, or revealing or building on top of them additional complexity and details as you go along."

**Insight:** Simplify complex problems by breaking them down into 'kindergarten level' building blocks before adding layers of complexity.

**Tactical advice:**
- Create a 'school pyramid' curriculum for projects, starting with basic building blocks
- Force yourself to explain the project at a kindergarten level to ensure the foundation is clear

*Timestamp: 00:56:12*


## Paige Costello
*Paige Costello*

> "The Double Diamond Process... forces people to get out of their opinion-driven lens... You go broad when you ask like, 'What customer should I solve for?' and then you pick one... Then, you go broad, and you say, 'What are the problems this customer has?' and you narrow, and you say, 'This is the problem they have.'"

**Insight:** The Double Diamond framework prevents opinion-driven decisions by forcing teams to systematically explore and then narrow down the target customer and problem space.

**Tactical advice:**
- Start by going broad on customer selection before narrowing to one target.
- Explore multiple potential problems for that customer before selecting the primary one to solve.

*Timestamp: 00:13:00*


## Peter Deng
*Peter Deng*

> "Sometimes your product actually doesn't matter... at Uber, I learned this because, really, the price and the ETA at Uber was the product. Looking at it from a holistic perspective, we humans consume the entirety of the product."

**Insight:** The 'product' is often the core utility (like price or speed) rather than the digital interface.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify the primary driver of user value (e.g., ETA vs. UI) and prioritize it
- Look at the product holistically, including operational and business model components

*Timestamp: 00:21:26*

---

> "The first thing is empathizing. You've got to really feel the pain of your customers... the define is also a really powerful word because it forces you to articulate what the problem is."

**Insight:** Rigorous problem definition requires deep empathy and the ability to articulate the customer's pain clearly.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use the IDEO framework: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test
- Force the team to write down and articulate the specific problem before ideating

*Timestamp: 01:32:44*


## Scott Wu
*Scott Wu*

> "The way that we often describe it is, I think, Devin is best when it is working on tasks that are well-defined. One way to put it is, you want to be giving Devin tasks, not problems."

**Insight:** Effective use of AI agents requires breaking down broad problems into specific, well-defined tasks with clear success criteria.

**Tactical advice:**
- Convert open-ended problems into discrete, actionable tasks before handing them to an AI agent
- Ensure tasks are easy to verify and test to facilitate the agent's iterative loop

*Timestamp: 00:47:55*


## Tobi Lutke
*Tobi Lutke*

> "You have to derive it from first principles. You have to say, 'How would we solve this problem given every fundamental building block that we have available right now?'... everything that you encounter, that every solution, every product, everything that exists is path-dependent, highly, highly, highly path-dependent, and often path-dependent based on having to make compromises, based on things that were true at the time a decision was made but are no longer true."

**Insight:** Define problems by stripping away path-dependent compromises and rebuilding solutions from current atomic building blocks.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify which assumptions in an existing solution are no longer true
- Derive solutions from the fundamental building blocks available today
- Avoid 'skipping the exercise' by simply copying how others solve a problem

*Timestamp: 00:29:38*

---

> "The amazing thing about software is we can actually just overtake this piece of complexity. We know what the taxes are everywhere and we are just doing it for you. You don't have to think about taxes. In this case we have someone encountered something that stunned them, that stopped them in their tracks... lowering complexity, making good UX, creating software that just autopilots taxes or payments or any of these kinds of things, fraud, actually causes more entrepreneurship."

**Insight:** True product value comes from identifying and absorbing the complexity that prevents users from making progress.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify 'stun points' where users stop because the software becomes too complex
- Use software to autopilot complex tasks (like taxes or fraud) so the user doesn't have to think about them
- Prioritize legible interfaces that tame complexity rather than just adding features

*Timestamp: 01:22:53*


## Varun Parmar
*Varun Parmar*

> "We have a product process that we follow, which starts with a P-strat, which is a strategy, and then we go into P0, which is definition of the problem, then we go into P1, which is definition of the solution, and then we go into P2, which is once the solution is shipped, are we hitting the metrics."

**Insight:** Formalizing the transition from problem definition (P0) to solution definition (P1) prevents teams from jumping to features too early.

**Tactical advice:**
- Require a 'P0' document that strictly defines the problem before any solutioning (P1) begins.
- Track the time spent in the 'problem definition' stage to identify teams that are rushing or getting stuck.

*Timestamp: 00:44:13*


## David Singleton
*David Singleton*

> "We have a process called friction logging. Put yourself in a user's shoes."

**Insight:** Friction logging systematically identifies pain points from user personas.

**Tactical advice:**
- Define specific user persona
- Go through product step by step

*Timestamp: 00:26:09*


## Jag Duggal
*Jag Duggal*

> "Really think hard and tap into a very deep pain point."

**Insight:** Start by identifying deep emotional pain points, not just functional problems.

**Tactical advice:**
- Look for high-profit AND highly-hated markets
- Observe more than ask

*Timestamp: 00:07:20*
