# Analyzing User Feedback

Help the user extract actionable insights from customer feedback using techniques from 56 product leaders.

## How to Help

When the user asks for help analyzing feedback:

1. **Understand their sources** - Ask where feedback is coming from (NPS, support, sales, social, interviews)
2. **Help identify patterns** - Assist in clustering feedback into themes and prioritizing by frequency and impact
3. **Challenge surface-level interpretations** - Push them to find root causes, not just stated complaints
4. **Connect to action** - Help translate insights into product decisions

## Core Principles

### Feedback is a river, not a lake
Shaun Clowes: "Really smart product managers are constantly swimming in a feedback river. Set up streams of user interview data, NPS, and competitor info to wash over you daily." Make feedback consumption continuous, not episodic.

### Users lie (unintentionally)
Bret Taylor: "Taking what a customer says in a focus group is rarely correct. Practice intellectual honesty to distinguish surface-level complaints from root causes." When users say "price," they often mean "value."

### Cluster, don't segment
Bob Moesta: "Instead of segmenting by demographics, we cluster by behavioral pathways. It's not one reason why people do things—it's sets of reasons." Look for the 'hire and fire' criteria for different user clusters.

### Every support ticket is a product failure
Geoff Charles: "We literally have 'every support ticket is a failure of our product' posted on all channels. Share every negative review with the relevant PM and designer monthly."

### The silent signals matter
Ramesh Johari: "There's a lot of information in ratings that are NOT left. The absence of a rating is often a strong signal of a mediocre experience users are too polite to report."

### Filter the 80% noise
Jen Abel: "80% of feedback is noise based on legacy habits, 20% is gold that guides the future product. It's the founder's job to interpret what's 'the old way' versus real market needs."

### Aggregate across all channels
Brian Balfour: "AI can analyze existing feedback AND identify knowledge gaps—what customers are NOT saying. Aggregate feedback from all sources into a centralized repository."

### Talk to churned users
Uri Levine: "The most critical insights come from users who dropped out of the funnel, not those who succeeded. Interview users who churned to find the 'why' behind the failure."

### Prioritize future users over vocal minorities
Tamar Yehoshua: "Don't over-index on people unhappy with your changes. Design for the bigger number of people who will use it tomorrow, not the vocal few complaining today."

### Make insights stick
Yuhki Yamashata: "The goal is 'memification'—synthesize insights so they're catchy enough for execs to cite in meetings. Use real-world metaphors to explain complex concepts."

## Questions to Help Users

- "Where is your feedback coming from? Are you missing any channels?"
- "Have you talked to churned users, or only happy customers?"
- "What's the pattern behind these complaints—what's the root cause?"
- "Are these requests from early adopters or from users stuck in old habits?"
- "How will you act on this insight?"

## Common Mistakes to Flag

- **Taking feedback literally** - Users say they want X but often need Y
- **Only listening to vocal users** - Silent majority may have different needs
- **Ignoring non-users** - People who didn't convert have critical insights
- **Feedback hoarding** - Insights trapped in silos don't help anyone
- **Hindsight bias** - Don't dismiss research findings as "obvious" after the fact

## Alexander Embiricos
*Alexander Embiricos*

> "A few of us are constantly on Reddit. There's praise up there and there's a lot of complaints... Reddit is a little more negative but real actually. So I've started increasingly paying attention to how people are talking about using Codex on Reddit actually... you get good signal on what matters and what other people think."

**Insight:** Unfiltered community platforms like Reddit provide higher-signal feedback on product flaws and 'real' user sentiment than more polished social platforms.

**Tactical advice:**
- Monitor niche subreddits for unfiltered product complaints and bug reports
- Use Reddit's upvoting mechanics to prioritize which user pain points to address first

*Timestamp: 00:56:44*


## Aishwarya Naresh Reganti + Kiriti Badam
*Aishwarya Naresh Reganti + Kiriti Badam*

> "You cannot practically sit and evaluate all the traces. You need some indication to understand what are the things that I should look at. And this is where production monitoring helps. And once you get this kind of traces, you need to examine what are the failure patterns that you're seeing in these different types of interactions."

**Insight:** Production monitoring should be used to filter and identify specific traces for manual error analysis and failure pattern identification.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use production monitoring to flag problematic traces for deeper review.
- Identify recurring failure patterns in user interactions to inform the creation of new evaluation datasets.

*Timestamp: 00:35:35*


## Anneka Gupta
*Anneka Gupta*

> "One way that we're using AI today is summarizing our user research calls. ... it'll find you the call, it'll find you the context, it'll find you the transcript and summarize exactly what we've learned from that call."

**Insight:** AI-driven summarization and tagging of user research calls allow for searchable, high-fidelity insights across the entire organization.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use tools like Dovetail to automate the transcription and summarization of customer discovery calls.

*Timestamp: 01:00:08*


## Barbra Gago
*Barbra Gago*

> "We did case studies throughout the process. We got feedback on logos. We got feedback on brand and designs, and there were plenty of people who were like, 'Oh, I like RealtimeBoard. It's straightforward.' They loved their product, but ultimately, we kept many of them informed and we really involved them in the process to the degree of not slowing us down but still getting feedback."

**Insight:** Involving core advocates in a rebranding process helps maintain loyalty while providing critical feedback on new visual directions.

**Tactical advice:**
- Run case studies and feedback sessions on new logos and designs with existing users
- Keep early advocates informed of major changes to maintain their sense of ownership

*Timestamp: 33:31*


## Bob Moesta
*Bob Moesta*

> "And then what we do is instead of trying to look for themes across all of them, we actually do something, instead of segmenting them, we cluster them, we find the pathways because what you start to realize is it's not one reason why people do it, it's sets of reasons."

**Insight:** User feedback should be clustered into behavioral 'pathways' rather than demographic segments.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify the 'hire and fire' criteria for different clusters of users.
- Look for conflicts where one user group wants speed while another wants thoroughness.

*Timestamp: 00:20:29*


## Brian Balfour
*Brian Balfour*

> "The first product we launched is called Reforge Insights, which acts like your AI product researcher, aggregates all the feedback from all the sources, uses AI to analyze it, helps you explore it, but also will start to identify what are the gaps, the things that you don't have in your feedback today and auto-generate the research to go gather all those new insights."

**Insight:** AI can be used to not only analyze existing feedback but also to identify 'knowledge gaps' and proactively generate research to fill them.

**Tactical advice:**
- Aggregate feedback from all sources into a centralized AI-analyzable repository.
- Use AI to identify what customers are NOT saying to guide future research efforts.

*Timestamp: 01:06:22*


## Brian Tolkin
*Brian Tolkin*

> "All these ideas and feedback that comes from everywhere, make sure it's written down for a number of reasons. One, you can then go reference it, but two, part of the job is making sure the people who present those ideas are heard and respected and know that it's at least somewhere where it was considered."

**Insight:** Systematically documenting all feedback ensures stakeholders feel heard and creates a searchable repository for future prioritization.

**Tactical advice:**
- Capture all feedback in a centralized backlog (Google Sheet, Jira, etc.) even if it won't be acted on immediately
- Acknowledge the source of the feedback to maintain cross-functional respect

*Timestamp: 00:56:33*


## Bret Taylor
*Bret Taylor*

> "Literally taking what a customer says or what a user says in a focus group or a usability study is rarely correct... it's very important to get right."

**Insight:** Users often provide 'polite' feedback that masks the true reason for lack of adoption; you must dig for the underlying truth.

**Tactical advice:**
- Practice intellectual honesty to distinguish between surface-level complaints (e.g., price) and root causes (e.g., lack of value)

*Timestamp: 00:21:16*


## Chandra Janakiraman
*Chandra Janakiraman*

> "The ask is really to create a meta analysis of all of the analysis... scan the historical archives at the company and sort of synthesize and condense that into a very sort of digestible macro themes."

**Insight:** Strategy should be informed by a high-level synthesis of existing behavioral data and research rather than starting from scratch.

**Tactical advice:**
- Create a meta-analysis of historical behavioral data and feature launch performance
- Synthesize 'soft' signals from customer service, social channels, and UXR into macro themes
- Have the strategy working group observe a user directly to build empathy

*Timestamp: 00:20:50*


## Christine Itwaru
*Christine Itwaru*

> "The synthesis of both this qualitative and quantitative data as a theme that I saw arising across our customer base... bringing all of these different inputs that would traditionally be handled by product manager... to the surface when they're going through their product development lifecycle planning."

**Insight:** Product operations centralizes and synthesizes diverse feedback sources to provide PMs with actionable insights during planning cycles.

**Tactical advice:**
- Aggregate qualitative feedback from sales and success with quantitative usage data
- Surface synthesized feedback themes specifically during the product development lifecycle planning phase

*Timestamp: 00:12:54*

---

> "We brought those folks in a room together... our head of professional services team at one point was like, 'Whoa, this could truly impact what we do from an onboarding perspective and now we have this data.'... The PM got risk data, high-priority deals, feedback from our feedback product. What are we hearing from prospects versus paying customers."

**Insight:** Cross-functional feedback sessions reveal how product issues impact different parts of the business, from onboarding to sales deals.

**Tactical advice:**
- Bring revenue, success, and product teams together to review feedback collectively
- Segment feedback by customer type, such as prospects versus paying customers, to identify high-priority deals at risk

*Timestamp: 00:16:46*


## Claire Butler
*Claire Butler*

> "We implemented Intercom back in the early days... Dylan would jump in, an engineer would jump in. And he'd open up a chat with people and they'd actually debug the product with us live. They'd be like, "I have this bug," and this engineer would be like, "Let me QA it right now.""

**Insight:** Direct, real-time interaction between engineers and users in the early days builds intense loyalty and ensures rapid bug resolution.

**Tactical advice:**
- Have the entire team, including engineers and founders, participate in early customer support
- Debug issues live with users to demonstrate extreme care and responsiveness

*Timestamp: 00:39:17*

---

> "We decided a couple years ago, we had this idea where we were like, oh, what if we package all of those quality updates up into one thing and launch them together and we could even show the tweet or the forum request that spurred us to do this. And that was where our idea of little big updates came."

**Insight:** Bundling small user-requested quality improvements into a single launch demonstrates that the company is listening and cares about user craft.

**Tactical advice:**
- Run 'quality weeks' where engineers fix small, high-annoyance bugs
- Publicly credit the specific user requests or tweets that inspired the updates

*Timestamp: 00:52:53*


## Dan Shipper
*Dan Shipper*

> "Same thing for if you've got tons of customer interviews or tons of customer data you want to go through, it's incredibly powerful for going and figuring stuff out from big data sets like that."

**Insight:** Autonomous agents can process and synthesize insights from massive datasets of qualitative user research more effectively than simple context-stuffing.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use an agentic CLI tool to read through every individual customer interview file to find specific behavioral patterns

*Timestamp: 00:11:05*


## Donna Lichaw
*Donna Lichaw*

> "Take a data-driven approach to the stories that you tell yourself. For example, the story, 'I'm too nice,' it could be true, it could not be true. How did we get down to the bottom of that? In this case, what we did is I went out there and talked to his team... And I found out how people actually experienced him and his leadership."

**Insight:** Treat leadership self-perception like product discovery by gathering objective data from 'customers' (colleagues) to validate or debunk internal narratives.

**Tactical advice:**
- Conduct informal 360-degree research to compare your internal self-story with how your team actually experiences your leadership.

*Timestamp: 00:16:55*


## Eeke de Milliano
*Eeke de Milliano*

> "We use Slack very heavily to talk to our customers... we have hundreds of Slack channels with customers. Every time we're testing a new product... We will work with them in Slack, to get there off-the-cuff feedback, just back and forth."

**Insight:** Direct, informal communication channels like Slack provide faster and more honest feedback loops than formal surveys.

**Tactical advice:**
- Create dedicated Slack channels for key customers or beta testers
- Use 'off-the-cuff' back-and-forth messaging to iterate on new features

*Timestamp: 00:52:34*


## Elizabeth Stone
*Elizabeth Stone*

> "We talk about it as a superpower internally in combining those skill sets. So I think the Consumer Insights team at Netflix has had a lot of credibility in a certain area of expertise and we took it to the next level by combining it with other functional expertise... combining attitudinal research, qualitative and quantitative with behavioral research on more of the data science, data engineering analytics side."

**Insight:** The most powerful insights come from merging qualitative 'attitudinal' research with quantitative 'behavioral' data science.

**Tactical advice:**
- Integrate user research (UXR) and data science teams to solve complex product problems
- Validate behavioral data trends with qualitative user interviews to understand the 'why' behind the 'what'

*Timestamp: 00:58:51*


## Ethan Smith
*Ethan Smith*

> "What are all the questions people are asking you on your sales calls, customer support on Reddit? Mine all those questions that exist somewhere else. Probably those same questions are being asked in chat."

**Insight:** Sales and support data are the best sources for identifying the specific, long-tail questions users ask AI engines.

**Tactical advice:**
- Review sales call transcripts for specific product comparison questions.
- Analyze customer support tickets to identify 'how-to' queries that aren't currently covered in your public documentation.

*Timestamp: 00:24:02*


## Geoff Charles
*Geoff Charles*

> "The first principle there was saying, 'Well, every support ticket is a failure of our product.' We literally have that as a quote just posted on all those channels. It's a failure."

**Insight:** Treat every customer support interaction as a signal of product friction that should be engineered away.

**Tactical advice:**
- Share every negative review with the relevant tech lead, PM, and designer monthly.
- Track 'customer confusion' tickets as a primary metric for user experience quality.
- Halt new feature shipping if operational burden or confusion metrics exceed a threshold.

*Timestamp: 00:47:30*


## Gibson Biddle
*Gibson Biddle*

> "I'm a feedback freak, so you'll notice at the end of every talk I do, every essay... there's a link to give me feedback. And it's always the same question: On a scale of zero to 10... how likely would you be to recommend this to a friend?"

**Insight:** Implement a consistent, simple feedback loop for every output to drive continuous improvement through data.

**Tactical advice:**
- Include a feedback link in every product or communication
- Ask for a numerical rating (0-10) plus 'what you liked' and 'what could be better'
- Review feedback daily to identify patterns for improvement

*Timestamp: 57:33*


## Hamel Husain & Shreya Shankar
*Hamel Husain & Shreya Shankar*

> "The first step in conquering data like this is just to write notes... You sample your data and just take a look, and it's surprising how much you learn when you do this."

**Insight:** Manual 'trace analysis' (reviewing logs) is the most effective way to understand how an AI product is actually performing.

**Tactical advice:**
- Sample production traces and manually annotate them
- Perform 'open coding' by writing down the first thing seen that is wrong

*Timestamp: 00:17:47*

---

> "Keep looking at traces until you feel like you're not learning anything new... theoretical saturation."

**Insight:** The manual review process should continue until the team stops discovering new types of failure modes.

**Tactical advice:**
- Aim for 'theoretical saturation' where no new error categories emerge
- Review at least 50-100 traces to build a representative taxonomy of errors

*Timestamp: 00:30:30*


## Guillermo Rauch
*Guillermo Rauch*

> "Create a lot of opportunities for people to give you feedback inside the product... a feedback button with a very slick inline form, with four emojis that would allow you to decide how you were feeling about the feature... That would go straight into Slack. And we were building day in and day out, just streaming users' thoughts right into our consciousness."

**Insight:** Tighten the feedback loop by streaming in-app user sentiment directly into real-time communication channels like Slack.

**Tactical advice:**
- Embed a simple feedback button with emoji-based sentiment selection.
- Integrate in-app feedback directly into a shared Slack channel for the entire team to see.

*Timestamp: 01:01:45*


## Gustav Söderström
*Gustav Söderström*

> "If you look at what people do on Spotify's homepage... it is almost 90% what we call recall... When we tested the design... we switched it from 90/10 to 10/90. 10% recall, 90% discovery. And while people want discovery, they probably don't want 90% discovery, instead of 90% recall."

**Insight:** User complaints during a redesign often stem from the loss of 'recall' (finding known items) rather than a dislike of new 'discovery' features.

**Tactical advice:**
- Distinguish between 'recall' intent and 'discovery' intent in usage data
- Compare new user cohorts (who have no old habits) against long-term users to identify if feedback is about habit-breaking or bad design

*Timestamp: 00:49:59*


## Inbal S
*Inbal S*

> "Spend time with customers and learn from your customers, because a lot of the innovative ideas are coming basically from conversation with customers because they're sharing with you their frustration, they're sharing with you what they would like to have, they're sharing with you what will be an amazing invention for them."

**Insight:** Customer frustrations are the primary source of innovative product ideas.

**Tactical advice:**
- Create mechanisms to gather feedback from both large and small community foundations
- Listen for 'amazing inventions' customers describe when discussing their pain points

*Timestamp: 34:55*


## Howie Liu
*Howie Liu*

> "doing a lot of LLM calls against long transcripts of let's say, sales calls to extract different types of insights like here's the product apps, identify or here's summaries, et cetera."

**Insight:** Use LLMs to aggressively process large volumes of qualitative data (like sales transcripts) to find strategic product and marketing insights.

**Tactical advice:**
- Run LLMs against sales call transcripts to identify product gaps and positioning insights
- Use 'map-reduce' LLM patterns to aggregate insights from massive datasets

*Timestamp: 00:14:49*


## Jeff Weinstein
*Jeff Weinstein*

> "If you are unsure what to measure... just make a user having a bad day chart, emit a log line and count it as a bar chart. ... It's like, oh, I'm working on making this chart go up and it feels good to just say the name out loud."

**Insight:** Tracking every instance of user friction as a 'bad day' event creates a prioritized backlog of quality improvements.

**Tactical advice:**
- Emit a log line every time a user hits a 404, a delay, or a decline.
- Create a stacked bar chart of 'bad day' reasons to identify the most frequent pain points.

*Timestamp: 01:01:14*


## Jen Abel
*Jen Abel 2.0*

> "It is the founder's job to interpret that because a lot of feedback you get is this is the old way, they're responding this way because it's the old way of working... 80% noise, 20% had I not asked this question, I wouldn't have gotten that gold in terms of where they are today."

**Insight:** Founders must filter user feedback from design partners, distinguishing between requests based on 'the old way' and insights that reveal true market needs.

**Tactical advice:**
- Apply the 80/20 rule to feedback: 80% is noise based on legacy habits, 20% is the 'gold' that guides the future product.

*Timestamp: 00:30:37*


## Judd Antin
*Judd Antin*

> "Everything is Obvious If You Already Know the Answer. And it's about hindsight bias... we end up selectively remembering things and then constructing narratives around them in a way which makes us feel like we already knew that, when we in fact did not."

**Insight:** Teams often suffer from hindsight bias and the narrative fallacy, dismissing research insights as 'obvious' after the fact.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use research to explain the 'how and why' behind data, which AB tests cannot provide.
- Be wary of creating simple, convenient stories about past events that ignore conflicting evidence.

*Timestamp: 00:43:16*


## Julie Zhuo
*Julie Zhuo 2.0*

> "Conversational analytics is totally different... it's actually harder for us to tease apart what is the user intent... we probably have to use an LLM or a machine learning model to bucket user intent."

**Insight:** In the AI era, user feedback is often unstructured conversation, requiring new machine-learning-based methodologies to synthesize intent.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use LLMs to bucket and synthesize user intent from conversational data.

*Timestamp: 00:30:16*


## Kristen Berman
*Kristen Berman*

> "We try to understand what people actually do versus what they say they will do. And by doing that, it becomes wildly clear that we should all be skeptical that budgeting would actually work to change the behavior that you're trying to get to."

**Insight:** User requests often fail to translate into actual behavior change; product teams should prioritize observed actions over stated preferences.

**Tactical advice:**
- Perform a behavioral diagnosis to see if a requested feature actually reduces the friction required for the target behavior.

*Timestamp: 09:03*


## Laura Schaffer
*Laura Schaffer*

> "I just started sharing a voice of the customer report. I started sharing my insights, started writing down and just sharing them. It became with digest and eventually people were like, 'Hey, can you share it with me? Can you share with me? Can you get on your list?'"

**Insight:** Distributing customer insights internally establishes you as a subject matter expert and builds trust with leadership.

**Tactical advice:**
- Create a regular 'voice of the customer' digest to share with the company
- Host quarterly sessions to present customer insights to the product organization
- Compile feedback from multiple departments to provide a holistic view of customer pain points

*Timestamp: 00:13:55*


## Maggie Crowley
*Maggie Crowley*

> "People who are really excited about being data-driven, to me that is oftentimes a red flag for their product thinking... they're over-emphasizing quantitative data at the expense of qualitative data and they're not using good judgment."

**Insight:** Over-reliance on dashboards can mask a lack of understanding of the human users and their motivations.

**Tactical advice:**
- Balance quantitative dashboards with direct user interviews to understand the 'why'
- Talk to 10 users to get better insights than a dashboard can provide
- Use judgment to identify 'obviously better' improvements that don't require exhaustive data justification

*Timestamp: 00:58:39*


## Marty Cagan
*Marty Cagan*

> "When we're doing user research, we're finding all the reasons they don't like it. In fact, that's an Elon Musk quote is when you do user a research, you should be focused on finding all the reasons they won't use your product."

**Insight:** The primary goal of evaluative research is to identify friction and reasons for rejection rather than seeking validation.

**Tactical advice:**
- Focus user research on finding reasons why a customer would NOT use the product
- Use evaluative research to uncover flaws in the solution

*Timestamp: 00:32:45*

---

> "The second thing is they have to be an expert in the data. How is your product used? How is that change over time? What's the sales analytics? What's the user analytics? So you have to know how your product is actually used"

**Insight:** PMs must have a deep, hands-on understanding of user behavior data and sales analytics.

**Tactical advice:**
- Study user analytics to understand how the product is used over time
- Analyze sales data to understand the business impact of product usage

*Timestamp: 00:40:41*

---

> "Another is you're supposed to be the expert on the data. How is our product being used? How is that usage changing over time? How is it being purchased? So that's big."

**Insight:** PMs must maintain deep quantitative expertise regarding product usage and purchasing trends.

**Tactical advice:**
- Become the primary expert on product usage data for your team.
- Track how usage patterns change over time to inform product decisions.

*Timestamp: 00:24:09*


## Matt MacInnis
*Matt MacInnis*

> "There's no greater gift to me as a product executive than receiving an escalation from a customer... Escalations are a gift... it's people who are just particularly skilled at pistol whipping other people in the company to get to real root causes."

**Insight:** Customer escalations are the best source of data for identifying systemic failures in the product or process.

**Tactical advice:**
- Treat every escalation as a gift and a chance to perform a deep root cause analysis.
- Trace errors back through the software, then the system, then the process that created the system.

*Timestamp: 01:13:09*


## Melissa Perri + Denise Tilles
*Melissa Perri + Denise Tilles*

> "It's also about aggregating all the interviews or customer research that's been done so people can query it and start to see what do we already know so we're not going out there and duplicating a bunch of research."

**Insight:** Centralizing research findings into a queryable database prevents redundant discovery work across the organization.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use tools like Dovetail to aggregate qualitative research
- Create a 'findings database' that allows team members to query past interview results

*Timestamp: 00:16:22*

---

> "Another piece of this too that we talk about is getting qualitative insights from sales and support... what we're trying to do is get that out of these individual systems and into somewhere where a lot of people can take those qualitative insights and start to learn from them."

**Insight:** Valuable product insights are often trapped in silos like Salesforce or support tickets and need to be synthesized for the product team.

**Tactical advice:**
- Extract customer feedback from Salesforce and support tickets into a central system
- Establish a feedback loop with sales to track churn reasons and feature requests systematically

*Timestamp: 00:17:30*


## Melanie Perkins
*Melanie Perkins*

> "We get more than a million requests from our community every year and we've got a whole incredible team that then tallies them, breaks them down, and then delivers them to all of our product teams and then those actually get closed."

**Insight:** Systematize the collection and categorization of high-volume user feedback to drive the product roadmap.

**Tactical advice:**
- Tally and categorize community requests to identify the most 'hotly requested' features
- Create a 'closing the loop' process where product teams are assigned specific community requests to resolve

*Timestamp: 00:38:17*


## Nick Turley
*Nick Turley*

> "I go through those in detail because it's not like I knew about those use cases either. They're very, very emergent and I just go through the comments and process because there's so much to learn. ... I find it very, very useful. It's just fun to watch people talk to each other about the various use cases that they have."

**Insight:** Social media platforms like TikTok are invaluable for discovering emergent, unpredicted use cases for general-purpose AI.

**Tactical advice:**
- Read comment sections on viral social posts to find novel user applications
- Use conversation classifiers to identify high-level trends in user data at scale

*Timestamp: 00:48:55*


## Nicole Forsgren
*Nicole Forsgren*

> "Data from people and data from systems are really important compliments because we can get certain insights from people that we'll never get from systems. Let's look at lead time from changes, for example, from commit to deploy. The speed might be fine, but people might tell you it's taking absolute heroics. It's some ridiculous Rube Goldberg machine. The system will never tell you that."

**Insight:** System telemetry often misses the 'human cost' or 'heroics' required to maintain performance, making qualitative feedback essential.

**Tactical advice:**
- Survey developers at least once a year to uncover insights that automated systems cannot capture.
- Look for disagreements between system data and user surveys; the surveys are often the more accurate reflection of reality.

*Timestamp: 00:37:27*


## Nikhyl Singhal
*Nikhyl Singhal*

> "You have to be great at pulling feedback, listening to it. You have to triangulate it from people that don't see you all the time, that do see you all the time, your peers. But you have to create an environment of safety where people feel like there is no worry about retaliation or concern"

**Insight:** To get 'ground truth' feedback, you must actively pull it from diverse sources and create psychological safety for the provider.

**Tactical advice:**
- Repeat feedback back to the provider better than they articulated it to show internalization
- Publicly share and credit constructive feedback you've received to encourage a feedback culture
- Look at the 'discard pile' of feedback—anomalies you previously dismissed—to find hidden development areas

*Timestamp: 00:31:43*


## Nikita Bier
*Nikita Bier*

> "Put live chat customer support in your app 24 hours a day... it's the best vehicle for getting feedback and doing user research because users will literally tell you the problem they're having."

**Insight:** Real-time support channels provide higher-quality, more immediate product signal than traditional research methods.

**Tactical advice:**
- Embed live chat in the app during the early launch phase
- Have a dedicated process for piping interesting support feedback directly into product development channels

*Timestamp: 00:32:18*


## Nilan Peiris
*Nilan Peiris*

> "And when you read the comments, and now obviously we've got all kinds of fancy models sitting on top of these things, customers kept telling us the same things, 'Make it faster, make it cheaper, make it easier to use.' ... And customers were pretty clear, the ones that were evangelical, is the word we use, are the ones that had a much... Had this cheaper experience, the ones that were talking about it had a fast experience."

**Insight:** Qualitative feedback in NPS comments is the most effective way to identify the core product pillars that drive user advocacy.

**Tactical advice:**
- Read the specific comments from 'evangelical' users (9-10 scorers) to understand what drives their excitement
- Aggregate feedback into high-level pillars like price, speed, and ease of use
- Share raw customer comments with the entire company to build collective conviction on what matters

> "Customer listening is different. It's not really discovery. It is the scarfing up of customer signals that are happening constantly anyway. So people are talking on social, people are talking on app stores and G2 crowd. If you have a instrumented churn survey, people are talking. If you have NPS, people are not only giving you the scores where they're putting in the verbatims."

**Insight:** Product teams should distinguish between active discovery and 'customer listening'—the systematic processing of existing signals from support, sales, and social media.

**Tactical advice:**
- Triage signals from Zendesk, Salesforce (closed-won/lost notes), and app store reviews to see frequency distributions.
- Organize a system where PMs and designers have customer signals automatically surfaced to them to reduce the friction of 'listening'.

> "Only one out of 10 companies actually do customer research or development on a quarterly basis. This should be a continuous thing, it should be a monthly, weekly type thing."

**Insight:** Regular customer research is a massive competitive advantage that correlates with higher NPS, better retention, and more efficient growth funnels.

**Tactical advice:**
- Commit to 10 non-sales customer conversations per month
- Send short, targeted surveys (30-45 seconds) rather than long, complex ones
- Use research to understand customer perception and worldviews rather than just taking feature requests

## Ramesh Johari
*Ramesh Johari*

> "There's a great concept in the literature on rating systems called the sound of silence, which is this idea that there's a lot of information in ratings that are not left... this was much more predictive of downstream performance of a seller. So there's a lot of information in that lack of a response."

**Insight:** The absence of a rating is often a strong signal of a mediocre or poor experience that users are too polite to report.

**Tactical advice:**
- Incorporate 'non-responses' into your quality metrics to get a more accurate picture of participant performance.

*Timestamp: 01:07:44*


## Robby Stein
*Robby Stein*

> "When we asked people to understand people like, 'Why aren't you posting to your story? What's preventing you from doing it?'... It was like this commonality was audience problem. Someone had an issue with people watching them."

**Insight:** Identifying a common psychological barrier across user feedback can lead to the creation of major new features like 'Close Friends'.

**Tactical advice:**
- Look for commonalities in why people *don't* use a feature to identify core product gaps.
- Use qualitative research to uncover 'audience problems' or social friction in sharing apps.

> "We call it build with writers, build with readers... do it in a way where we bring writers along... We actually have now we've set up something called the Product Lab... an invite only little group of a hundred or so writers that we know are interested in being on the bleeding edge."

**Insight:** Establish a dedicated 'Product Lab' of power users to provide rapid feedback and co-create features before a general rollout.

**Tactical advice:**
- Run small pilots with a subset of users to test high-risk or fundamental changes.
- Use direct feedback from these groups to iterate on the feature's design before it hits the broader dashboard.

## Sean Ellis
*Sean Ellis*

> "One of my favorite questions is... 'What is the primary benefit that you get?' And then I use that initially as an open-ended question to kind of crowdsource different benefits people are getting. But then I run another survey where I turn it into a multiple choice question, force them to pick one of four distinctive benefit statements. And then the question that follows on that next survey is, 'Why is that benefit important to you?'"

**Insight:** A two-step survey process (open-ended then multiple choice) helps quantify and contextualize the core value proposition.

**Tactical advice:**
- Crowdsource benefits with open-ended questions first.
- Use multiple-choice follow-ups to force prioritization of benefits.
- Ask 'Why is this important to you?' to understand the user's context and pain points.

*Timestamp: 00:14:59*

> "Why don't we just ask them why they signed up and didn't download the software? ... we just asked, 'Hey, notice you haven't had a chance to use the product yet. It looked like it was coming from customer support. What happened?' And the answer we got back... was, 'Oh, this seemed too good to be true. I didn't believe this was free.'"

**Insight:** Directly asking users about friction points in the funnel can reveal non-obvious psychological barriers to activation.

**Tactical advice:**
- Send personal-looking emails from 'customer support' to users who drop off at specific funnel steps.
- Ask open-ended questions about why they didn't complete a specific action (e.g., downloading or installing).

## Shaun Clowes
*Shaun Clowes*

> "He used to call this concept a Feedback River, and he basically said that really smart product managers are constantly swimming at a Feedback River. They set out to surround themselves by Feedback River and I really deeply believe in that."

**Insight:** Top PMs create systems to continuously immerse themselves in diverse streams of customer and market feedback.

**Tactical advice:**
- Set up automated streams of user interview data, NPS, and competitor info to 'wash over' you daily.

*Timestamp: 00:17:26*

> "We use LLMs to take in those asks to summarize what they're about, to find other asks that are like that one, really in a compelling way, a real way, like a semantic way, not other words, exactly the same, are these the same concept? So that we can look across all of the inbound demand on us and say, 'Well, the most popular idea is this one and is getting more popular.'"

**Insight:** Semantic analysis using LLMs allows for more accurate clustering and prioritization of high-volume customer feedback than keyword matching.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use LLMs to perform semantic clustering on inbound customer requests to identify true trends in demand.

> "The human brain is trained to, or the human drivers are sort of in subconsciously, they slow down when they go downhill in those slopes. The autonomous vehicle doesn't necessarily have to do that if it's safe... But we learned that this is a more natural driving experience and this is what our riders would also expect in terms of the experience. So that's something that we then modify the behavior on."

**Insight:** User feedback can reveal subconscious human expectations that contradict purely logical or technical optimizations.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify gaps where technically 'correct' behavior feels 'unnatural' to users.
- Modify system behavior to align with the subconscious habits and expectations of users.

> "Our research agent basically is trained on the personas of our members... It's using not just world knowledge, it's using all the research we've done in the past, all the support tickets coming in. So it's pretty good at understanding that persona at LinkedIn."

**Insight:** AI agents can synthesize years of historical research and customer support data to provide instant feedback on how a specific user persona might react to a new feature.

**Tactical advice:**
- Train research agents on internal personas and historical user research
- Feed support tickets into AI models to provide a 'voice of the customer' during the design phase

> "we were worried about certain sellers not being able to meet the demand that they were seeing. And so we did the old-fashioned thing, of not personally, but we called them and we said, 'How are you guys doing? What can we do to help?'"

**Insight:** Direct, 'old-fashioned' outreach to users during periods of volatility provides critical qualitative insights that data alone cannot capture.

**Tactical advice:**
- Call power users directly during crisis or high-growth periods to understand their immediate needs.
- Ask open-ended questions like 'What can we do to help?' to uncover hidden pain points.

*Timestamp: 00:15:20*


## Uri Levine
*Uri Levine*

> "In order to improve, we need to speak with those that fail, those that were unsuccessful, those that did not register, or they did register and did not use, or they did use and did not come back, because they know something that we really need to know."

**Insight:** The most critical insights for product improvement come from users who dropped out of the funnel, not those who were successful.

**Tactical advice:**
- Interview users who churned or failed to complete registration to find the 'why' behind the failure.

*Timestamp: 01:12:17*


## Vijay
*Vijay*

> "What this created was this culture where all engineers and designers could consume that raw feed of direct points of customer with no gatekeeper, no process to access it, no pre-aggregation"

**Insight:** Democratize customer feedback by piping raw, unedited user pain points directly into shared team channels.

**Tactical advice:**
- Pipe customer 'gaps' from sales and success teams directly into a Slack feed
- Encourage engineers to reach out directly to customers to ask 'the five whys' behind a specific feedback point
- Enrich feedback feeds with account data (ARR, CSM name) to provide context for the team

## Yuhki Yamashata

> "We created this new channel, private channel called Concerning Tweets, and it just, we're this small group of us that Dylan can drop us in. And these are tweets that aren't going viral, by any means. They're just things that you see is with one like, sometimes zero likes, but he feels there's an essence of truth to them and we make sure that we look at what's going on there and see if there isn't something much bigger that we should be focusing on."

**Insight:** High-quality product development requires monitoring low-signal feedback (like single-digit like tweets) as 'canaries in the coal mine' for larger issues.

**Tactical advice:**
- Create a dedicated channel for 'concerning' low-volume feedback
- Balance vocal minorities on social media with broader data from support tickets and sales
- Treat individual complaints as potential signals for systemic blind spots

*Timestamp: 00:25:31*


## Dylan Field
*Dylan Field*

> "I definitely look everywhere trying to constantly ingest information about Figma, and it's not just Twitter/X, whatever that's called now, but anywhere on the internet, support channels, et cetera. And I'm always trying to understand. I also ask a lot of questions and I try to get to root problems and understand where people are coming from and what are they actually trying to solve. Sometimes people are saying, 'Hey, I need X', but they really want Y or Z."

**Insight:** To truly understand user feedback, you must look across all channels and ask probing questions to distinguish between stated requests and root needs.

**Tactical advice:**
- Monitor non-traditional channels like social media and support forums to ingest broad feedback
- Ask follow-up questions to uncover the 'Y or Z' problem behind a user's request for 'X'

*Timestamp: 12:00*


## Josh Miller
*Josh Miller*

> "Membership... we need to have a deep, genuine, ongoing relationship with them. And on day one, that may be air quote, 'customer success.' ... On day 37, that might be, 'I have a bug.' ... And on day 58, that may be, 'Hey, we're shipping the mobile app soon. What do you want from mobile?' Other companies view that as different orgs and disciplines. We view that as, there are a bunch of people at the other end of this that we are serving"

**Insight:** Consolidate customer support, success, and user research into a single 'Membership' function to maintain a holistic, long-term relationship with users.

**Tactical advice:**
- Own the user relationship 'full stack' from first touch to long-term retention
- Use the same team for bug reports and feature discovery to maintain context

*Timestamp: 00:47:36*


## Megan Cook
*Megan Cook*

> "First of all, I mentioned we had that survey and so we had really rich feedback. So it's not just a rating, what we get, we get people talking about why they gave that rating and that can really help us zero in on what are the key aspects that's bringing this down."

**Insight:** Deeply analyze qualitative survey feedback to identify the specific usability issues driving quantitative satisfaction scores.

**Tactical advice:**
- Focus on the 'why' behind CSAT or NPS ratings to find actionable usability gaps
- Share visceral customer feedback (videos or quotes) with the team to build emotional investment in quality improvements
- Connect usability improvements to business metrics like acquisition and expansion

*Timestamp: 00:39:05*


## Tamar Yehoshua
*Tamar Yehoshua*

> "One of the mistakes that I see a lot of product managers make is they over index on people who are going to be unhappy with the products they're launching... design it for the bigger number of people who are going to be using it tomorrow. If you have to redo the UI and the Who Moved My Cheese, people will be unhappy, but all the new people are going to be like, 'This is so much easier.'"

**Insight:** Product managers must prioritize the needs of future scale over the complaints of a vocal minority of current users.

**Tactical advice:**
- Be transparent and authentic when explaining why a change was made, rather than using 'marketing speak'.
- Give users a choice or a transition period when sunsetting features to make them feel heard.
